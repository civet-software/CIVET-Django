    textlede: Suicide car bomb near Libya's Misrata kills 6 people
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        The official media agency for Libya's milita-backed government says a suicide car <b>bomb killed</b> 6 people near the western city of Misrata.
        
        It says that the dead from Saturday's bombing included a mother and her two sons, and that 21 others were injured.
        
        A security official from Misrata, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to journalists, says that most of the wounded were militiamen guarding a gate to the city, the apparent target of the attack.
        
        Militias from Misrata serve as a key power base for Libya's Tripoli-based government. Misrata has recently sent its militias to battle Islamic State-affiliated militants who control the central Libyan city of Sirte.
        
        Libya has two rival governments claiming legitimacy as their allied militias fight across the country.
