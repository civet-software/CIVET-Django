    textlede: Dozens dead as dairy bombed in war-torn Yemen
    textoriginal: |
        Dozens of civilians were reported killed Wednesday when a dairy was bombed in Yemen, as aid groups warned of a brewing humanitarian crisis from the Saudi-led coalition's strikes on Shiite rebels.
        
        Yemen's foreign minister called for the coalition to send in ground troops, saying that, "at some stage, air strikes will be ineffective".
        
        Diplomats said meanwhile that Gulf countries were locked in tough negotiations with Russia on a UN draft resolution to impose an arms embargo and sanctions on the Huthi Shiite rebels.
        
        But rights groups have voiced growing alarm about civilian casualties from the nearly week-old air war aimed at preventing the fall of President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi.
        
        At least 37 workers were killed and 80 wounded overnight at the dairy in the Red Sea port of Hodeida, Governor Hasan al-Hai said, without specifying whether the plant was hit by an air strike or rebel shelling.
        
        Health authorities said 35 people were killed and dozens wounded, and that rescuers had to search for survivors under the rubble of the partly destroyed factory.
        
        The circumstances of the bombing were unclear, with some witnesses saying the dairy was hit by a coalition strike and others blaming rebels loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh.
        
        Coalition spokesman Brigadier General Ahmed Assiri accused the Huthis of targeting the site, using "mortar shells and Katyusha rockets... in a bid to create unrest among the Yemeni society".
        
        The Arab forces would continue to "evaluate targets" and "lower the chances of targeting civilians or aid workers," he said, urging humanitarian organisations to "contact concerned parties in order to facilitate this process".
