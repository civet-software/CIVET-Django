    textlede: Saudis Find Head of American Hostage; Lockheed Martin Employee Was Decapitated in June by Islamic Extremist Group
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Saudi Arabian security forces reported Wednesday that they had found the severed head of a slain American hostage in a suspected hideout for Islamic radicals in Riyadh, the capital.
        
        The head of Paul M. Johnson Jr., an employee of Bethesda-based Lockheed Martin Corp. who was killed a month ago, was discovered late Tuesday in a freezer during a search of a building that Saudi officials described as a safe house for an extremist group calling itself al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The rest of the body was not found.
        
        Saudi security forces killed two suspected members of the group and wounded three others in a gun battle in the King Fahd district of Riyadh, government officials said. Among those killed was Issa Saad Oushan, who was on a list of the 26 most-wanted terrorism suspects in the kingdom, according to a statement released by the Saudi Interior Ministry.
        
        Security forces also captured the wife and three children of Saleh Awfi, the self-proclaimed leader of the group, which is affiliated with Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network, Saudi officials said.
        
        Johnson was kidnapped June 12 after he left work near King Khalid International Airport outside Riyadh. On the same day, an American co-worker was slain by gunmen in his garage, also after leaving work. A week later, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula posted a videotape on the Internet showing Johnson's decapitated body.
        
        Within hours of the posting, Saudi security forces tracked down Abdulaziz Muqrin, then the leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the man who asserted responsibility for Johnson's killing. Muqrin and three others died in a shootout at a Riyadh gas station, but a dragnet by thousands of Saudi police officers and other security agents was unable to find Johnson's remains.
        
        Last week, the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh announced that the search for the remains had been called off after more than a month of fruitless effort. Saudi officials said their investigation would continue.
        
        On Wednesday, the Saudi ambassador to the United States said that authorities would continue to search for the rest of Johnson's body.
        
        "We have been committed to doing everything we can to find the remains so that he can have a proper burial and the family can bring closure to this tragic situation," Prince Bandar bin Sultan said in a statement.
        
        More than 85 people have died since al Qaeda-linked groups began a series of suicide bombings, kidnappings and other attacks in Saudi Arabia in May 2003.
        
        No attacks have occurred since Johnson's death, although Saudi security forces have skirmished with suspected radicals on several occasions. According to government reports, security forces have captured or killed at least 15 of the 26 suspected terrorists on the kingdom's most-wanted list.

        SEARCH ENDS FOR BODY OF BEHEADED CONTRACTOR
        
        BERLIN
        
        Saudi and U.S. officials announced Wednesday that they had ended their search for the body of Paul M. Johnson Jr., the American military contractor who was kidnapped last month in Riyadh and later beheaded by Islamic radicals.
        
        A group calling itself al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility on June 18 for killing Johnson, an employee of Bethesda, Md.-based Lockheed Martin Corp., and posted photos of his decapitated corpse on the Internet. U.S. and Saudi officials said they were certain that the pictures were authentic and that Johnson was dead, but they have been unable to find his remains.
        
        James Oberwetter, the U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia, said Wednesday that authorities decided to call off the search after running out of clues.
        
        "We did everything we could to find Paul and bring him home," he said in a statement released by the U.S. Embassy.
        
        An FBI search-and-rescue team and a squad of hostage negotiators arrived in Riyadh shortly after Johnson was reported missing by his family on June 12. An FBI canine unit that specializes in locating bodies was also deployed to Riyadh after Johnson's death and spent three weeks on the search, U.S. officials said. The FBI and Saudi security forces will continue a criminal investigation into Johnson's death.
        
        Johnson's son, Paul M. Johnson III, had traveled throughout the Middle East in recent weeks in an attempt to publicize the search for his father's body.
        
        IMMIGRANTS TO ISRAEL INCLUDE 400 FROM U.S.
        
        BEN GURION AIRPORT, ISRAEL
        
        About 500 Jewish immigrants from North America, including 400 from the United States, arrived in Israel on Wednesday, one of the largest single-day numbers in recent months.
        
        The immigrants are backed by the Jewish Souls United group, which gives financial support to Jews wanting to move to Israel. The group expects to help 1,500 North American Jews immigrate to Israel by the end of summer, leaders said.
        
        So far this year, 930 U.S. residents have immigrated to Israel, the Tourism Ministry said.
        
        Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon greeted the 500 immigrants at an airport hangar.
        
        "By coming here, you have sent a sound message to the world," he said.
        
        "Israel is and always will be the eternal homeland for the Jewish people."
        
        Israel tries to attract as many Jews as possible to live in the country. Jews are eligible for automatic citizenship, and newcomers receive substantial government assistance.
        
        ISRAEL EXPECTS VOLATILITY WHEN ARAFAT DIES
        
        JERUSALEM
        
        Israel is worried about chaos that might follow the death of Yasser Arafat and will do everything possible to prevent the Palestinian leader from being buried in Jerusalem, according to a contingency plan obtained Wednesday by the Associated Press.
        
        The five-page document, prepared by the Foreign Ministry, lays out a series of forecasts about what might follow Arafat's death: the collapse of the Palestinian Authority, a challenge by Islamic militants, and upheaval in other parts of the Middle East.
        
        Despite Israeli efforts to isolate the Palestinian leader, Arafat continues to wield tremendous influence. The plan shows that he will remain a subject of concern to Israel - even in death.
        
        The plan includes recommendations on how to contain what Israel expects to be an extremely volatile environment. The stickiest issue, it says, will be where to bury Arafat.
        
        ATTORNEY GENERAL, OTHERS IMPLANTED WITH CHIPS
        
        MEXICO CITY
        
        Security has reached the subcutaneous level for Mexico's attorney general and at least 160 people in his office - they have been implanted with microchips that get them access to secure areas of their headquarters.
        
        It's a pioneering application of a technology that is widely used in animals but not in humans.
        
        Mexico's top federal prosecutors and investigators began receiving chip implants in their arms in November in order to get access to restricted areas inside the attorney general's headquarters, said Antonio Aceves, general director of Solusat, the company that distributes the microchips in Mexico.
        
        Attorney General Rafael Macedo de la Concha and 160 of his employees were implanted at a cost to taxpayers of $150 for each rice grain-size chip.
        
        More are scheduled to get "tagged" in coming months, and key members of the Mexican military, the police and the office of President Vicente Fox might follow suit, Aceves said. Fox's office did not immediately return a call seeking comment.

        DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan; MADRID
        
        President Hamid Karzai issued a decree on Wednesday ordering the "severest of punishments" for anyone who refuses to relinquish weapons under a U.N. disarmament program.
        
        The decree, which becomes law immediately, follows Karzai's pledge last week to crack down on warlords and militia commanders who have resisted disarmament. Karzai said Sunday that persuasion had failed to bring compliance from the warlords and that harsher measures would be used to force them to lay down their arms.
        
        Intimidation of citizens by rival warlords and their militias caused the government to announce last week a six-month delay of parliamentary elections.
        
        Saudi oil stopped Spain
        
        from policing, expert says
        
        MADRID - The Spanish government deliberately ignored a mosque known for fundamentalist preachings and frequented by suspects in the Madrid train bombings because the facility was financed by Saudi Arabia, an academic expert testified Wednesday.
        
        Spanish authorities knew for years the city's largest mosque, the Islamic Cultural Center, adhered to the Wahabi fundamentalist movement sponsored by Saudi Arabia, Islam expert Jesus Nunez told a commission investigating the March 11 bombings.
        
        Authorities did nothing to monitor the mosque because Saudi Arabia provides Spain with oil, Nunez said.

        TERROR SUSPECTS HELD: Bahraini authorities rearrested six men Wednesday, saying they planned to bomb government and foreign interests here, the Interior Ministry said Wednesday. The six men, most of whom are believed to be part of Bahrain's Salafi Muslim community, originally were released June 23 after being detained for a day. An Interior Ministry official for the Persian Gulf island country said the men were rearrested after investigators searched their computers and discovered documents on bombs and poisons.

    textlede: Saudi fighters return home: to continue war Riyadh braces for violence from veterans of Iraqi conflict
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia
        
        RIYADH, Saudi Arabia - A growing number of Saudis who had gone to Iraq to fight the U.S.-led military occupation are returning home to plot attacks against the Saudi government and Western targets, according to Western counter-terrorism officials and Saudis with ties to militant groups.
        
        The Iraq veterans are serving as fresh recruits for an underground network in Saudi Arabia that, until recently, was led by an older generation of fighters trained in Afghanistan and closely connected to al-Qaeda and its founder, Saudi native Osama bin Laden. Many of those leaders have been killed or captured in recent months by Saudi security forces.
        
        Today, the proclaimed new chief of the primary militant group in the kingdom is Saleh Awfi, 33, a Saudi who journeyed north last year to join Ansar al-Islam, an Islamic radical group in Iraq the U.S. government has branded as a terrorist organization. Mr. Awfi stayed for a few months, barely surviving U.S. aerial bombardment, before returning home to take up arms, according to a former Saudi radical who met Mr. Awfi last year.
        
        Other Saudis are returning after spending time in newly established training camps across the Red Sea in remote parts of Sudan, where central government influence is weak, said a European intelligence official whose government advises Saudi officials on their domestic terrorist threat.
        
        For years, the religiously conservative Saudi royal family considered itself immune to attacks from Islamic extremists, but since May 2003, terrorists have shaken the government with bombings and shootings, causing more than 80 deaths.
        
        The violence has helped drive oil prices to record highs, due to concern the radicals will target pipelines or refineries in the petroleum-rich state.
        
        The Saudi government sealed its border with Iraq last year and has played down evidence that Saudi radicals have contributed to the insurgency there. But Western counterterrorism officials and diplomats here said a small but significant number of Saudi veterans of the fight in Iraq have already returned and are helping to carry out attacks in the kingdom.
        
        Some Western officials express fear that the homecoming will grow if Iraq stabilizes. They also say they worry that the trend could become an echo of the 1990s, when thousands of Saudis travelled to Afghanistan to enlist in training camps sponsored by al-Qaeda and other
        
        Islamic groups. Many of those radicals were dispatched around the world to launch attacks, including the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackings in the U.S.
        
        After the Iraq insurgency is over, "there will be people who are freshly trained in the art of guerrilla warfare," said a Western diplomat.
        
        Recent statements from Saudi militants underscore the Iraq connection. A cell that took responsibility last month for the beheading of Paul Johnson, a Lockheed Martin Corp. employee kidnapped in Riyadh, called itself the Fallujah Brigade of a broader group known as al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Fallujah is a city west of Baghdad where insurgents have clashed with U.S. forces.
        
        Like their compatriots in Iraq, cells operating in Saudi Arabia have repeatedly stated their primary aim is to drive out all
        
        "infidels," including more than 100,000 Western expatriates who help run the country's oil industry.

        DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia
        
        An increasing number of Saudis who crossed the border into Iraq to fight the U.S.-led military occupation are returning home to plot attacks against the Saudi government and Western targets in the desert kingdom, according to Western counterterrorism officials and Saudis with ties to militant groups.
        
        The Iraq veterans are serving as fresh recruits for an underground network in Saudi Arabia that, until recently, was led by an older generation of fighters that had trained in Afghanistan and was closely connected to al Qaeda and its founder, Saudi native Osama bin Laden.

        The violence has helped drive oil prices to record highs, due to concern that the radicals will target pipelines or refineries.

        After the Iraq insurgency is over, "there will be people who are freshly trained in the art of guerrilla warfare," said a Western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity.
        
        "It's a real concern. How big a concern? I don't know. It clearly doesn't take too many to do a lot of damage."
        
        Recent statements from Saudi militants underscore the Iraq connection. A cell that asserted responsibility last month for the beheading of Paul M. Johnson Jr., a Lockheed Martin Corp. employee kidnapped in Riyadh, called itself the Fallujah Brigade of a broader group known as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Fallujah is a city west of Baghdad where insurgents have repeatedly clashed with U.S. forces.
        
        The leader of that cell, Abdulaziz Muqrin, who was killed three weeks ago in a shootout with security forces, suggested in a statement that appeared on the Internet last fall that there was substantial crossover between the group in Saudi Arabia and foreign fighters in Iraq.
        
        "We are exerting our efforts there," Muqrin wrote, according to Janes Intelligence Review, a London-based publication.
        
        Another example of Saudi fighters coming home from Iraq emerged in late June, when Othman Amri surrendered to Saudi officials under a recently declared amnesty program. Amri had been No. 19 on a list of the kingdom's 26 most wanted terrorism suspects. His family told Saudi reporters that he spent much of last year in Iraq as part of the insurgency there.
        
        Like their compatriots in Iraq, cells operating in Saudi Arabia have repeatedly stated that their primary aim is to drive out all "infidels," including more than 100,000 Western expatriates who help run the country's oil industry and whose military and technical support is crucial to the Saudi government.
        
        Although the border with Iraq is officially closed, many Saudi fighters are still finding their way back into the kingdom. Saudi officials said the nation's 900-mile border with Yemen has become an even more favored reentry point. Officials have reported that border guards have confiscated tons of explosives and ammunition from smugglers. In response, the Saudi government has begun construction of a concrete barrier along the Yemeni border, which runs through an especially desolate stretch of desert and mountains.
        
        The frequency of attacks within Saudi Arabia has picked up in the past two months, as attackers have conducted deadly raids on Western compounds in Khobar and blown up a police building in Riyadh. In May, they began to target individual Westerners in Riyadh, killing a German man at a bank machine and stalking two Americans before fatally shooting them at their homes.
        
        Saudi security forces have arrested hundreds of alleged radicals and sympathizers but largely have been unable to stop the violence since it ignited 14 months ago. Saudi leaders said they are optimistic, however, that their efforts reached a turning point when security forces killed Muqrin and three of his lieutenants in a shootout in Riyadh. Since then, security forces have gone on the offensive and have rounded up numerous other suspects by identifying several hideouts they used in the Riyadh area.
        
        Saudi security officials said they have disrupted each of the five cells known to exist in the kingdom. Although 12 of the government's 26 most wanted terrorist suspects remain at large, Western and Saudi counterterrorism officials said the movement has been dealt a heavy blow.
        
        "The terrorist networks created over the past few years have been almost entirely compromised and will have to be rebuilt largely from scratch," said Nawaf Obaid, a Riyadh-based security consultant.
        
        "There are no longer any known senior, battle-hardened bin Laden associates left to run the organization or create new cells."
        
        Most of the original architects of that network were veterans of al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan, including several who were personal acquaintances of bin Laden, according to Saudi officials.
        
        The Saudi government has long drawn criticism for allowing Islamic extremism to flourish within the kingdom and encouraging it abroad. Many Saudi leaders have minimized their responsibility, arguing that the insurgents became radicalized only after leaving the country.
        
        Prince Saud Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister, told reporters in Jiddah last month that "the university of Afghanistan" had brainwashed many Saudis.
        
        "They were being mentally reformed and turned into killing machines," he said.
        
        But other officials said most of the leaders trained in Afghanistan have been killed or captured, creating a void that is being filled by younger people whose primary fighting experience comes from Iraq or North Africa, or who have never been out of Saudi Arabia.
        
        "The Afghanistan group is starting to get aged," the Western diplomat said.
        
        "A lot of them are now out of the system. I don't know how many of those guys are really left."
        
        Other analysts said the Afghan veterans presented a more serious threat and questioned the ability of their replacements.
        
        "You have two distinct generations," said Ramzi Khoury, a journalist who tracks violent extremists in the kingdom.
        
        "You have those guys who came from Afghanistan, who are very well trained, very effective, very well brainwashed. And you have the kids. The kids are angry and depressed, angry over what's going on in Palestine and Iraq."
        
        Awfi, the apparent new leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, traveled to Afghanistan before Sept. 11, 2001, and met with bin Laden, according to interviews his family has given to Saudi reporters. More recently, he spent time in northern Iraq, but returned to Saudi Arabia after he was nearly killed during the U.S. invasion, according to Mohsen Awajy, a lawyer and former Saudi radical who said he was contacted by Awfi last year.
        
        Although Awfi's militant resume looks impressive on paper, his ascension is a sign that the group has become severely weakened, Awajy said.
        
        "If he's going to be the next leader of al Qaeda in Saudi Arabia," he said, "then they are in big trouble, because he has no capability as a leader."
        
        The Saudi security forces, however, have been confronted by weaknesses of their own. Counterterrorism experts and government officials said the kingdom was ill-prepared to respond to terrorism, in part because the government mistakenly assumed it would never become a target.
        
        That began to change in May 2003, as radicals launched attacks not just against Westerners, but also against Saudi citizens and the government.
        
        "The Saudi government was jolted out of its denial," said Jonathan Stevenson, senior fellow for counterterrorism at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.
        
        Although the government now says it takes terrorism much more seriously, its military and security forces were not trained or equipped to handle the threat and have had a hard time adjusting.
        
        More than a dozen Saudi police officers and National Guardsmen have died in shootouts, in many cases because they were outgunned. In May, three of four gunmen who killed 22 people and took hostages in a Western office and residential compound in Khobar escaped, even though they were surrounded by hundreds of security forces, including a special anti-terrorist Saudi SWAT team.
        
        "Our security apparatus is not well trained in combating terrorism, but they are learning," Ibrahim Alebaji, a former deputy interior minister, told Saudi television last month.
        
        Saudi Arabia's rulers have requested assistance from Western governments to help with training and intelligence gathering. Western counterterrorism officials said the Saudi capability to fight terrorism was improving, but that the kingdom still needed to reorganize its many overlapping military, law-enforcement and security agencies.
        
        "Saudi Arabia did not believe -- or did not want to believe -- that it had a problem for a long time," said a German intelligence official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
        
        "They are not underestimating the problem any longer \.\.\. But they first need to create the structures to fight the problem."
        
        Saudi officials used to bristle at such critiques, but have begun to acknowledge the need to revamp their anti-terrorism bureaucracy. Two weeks ago, Prince Saud of the Foreign Ministry met with Western diplomats and businessmen in Jiddah to reassure them that the government recognized the challenge.
        
        "He was quite explicit," said another Western diplomat who attended the meeting and also spoke on condition of anonymity.
        
        "He said, 'Yes, we have made mistakes. And we are learning from those mistakes.'"
        
        Technical assistance from the West has already produced results. A newly trained Saudi forensics unit was recently able to confirm, based on physical evidence, that a single al Qaeda cell was responsible for carrying out at least five separate attacks, according to a Western official.
        
        Researchers Robert Thomason and Margot Williams in Washington contributed to this report.

        * No sign of mad cow disease was found in an animal that was singled out in preliminary screening last week, the Agriculture Department said yesterday after a follow-up test. Officials declined to provide any additional information about the animal. Test results on a second carcass that was singled out Tuesday as possibly being infected will not be available for several days. The only U.S. case of mad cow disease was discovered in December in a Washington state cow that had been imported from Canada.

        health insurance
        
        * The percentage of American children with no health insurance has dropped to the lowest level on record because of expanded state programs, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said yesterday. The CDC said 10.1 percent of U.S. children were uninsured last year, down from 13.9 percent in 1997. But the percentage of working-age adults without coverage increased, from 18.9 percent in 1997 to 20.1 percent in 2003, the CDC said.

A federal jury acquitted Sami Omar al-Hussayen of the terrorism charges in June. But jurors deadlocked on eight additional charges, all of which were dropped in return for his dropping an appeal of a deportation order. He will return to Saudi Arabia.

    textlede: Beheading sparks anti-Islamic crime
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        THE family of murdered American engineer Paul Johnson has called on the Saudi Arabian regime and US government to try harder to find his remains and send them home.
        
        The plea was made yesterday following a memorial service for Mr Johnson in the New Jersey town of Egg Harbor Township.
        
        It also coincided with a rise in anti-Islamic crime in the US, sparked by Mr Johnson's death and the earlier beheading in Iraq of American Nicholas Berg, 26.
        
        Mosques around the country have been vandalised and hate mail and threats have escalated.
        
        Mr Johnson, 49, was beheaded by al-Qaida followers on June 18 after being kidnapped in the Saudi capital Riyadh where he had worked for more than a decade for Lockheed-Martin.
        
        Hours after his murder was broadcast on the Internet, raiding Saudi forces killed the chief of al-Qaida in the Arabian peninsula, Abdul Aziz al-Muqrin, but Mr Johnson's remains were not found.
        
        "Paul loved Saudi Arabia and its people," Pastor Kyle Huber said on behalf of the Mr Johnson's family after the service.
        
        "He gave over 10 years of his life to his work, much of which benefited the Saudi military.
        
        "The Saudi Government owes him and our family more answers surrounding his death and their continued best efforts to locate his remains."
        
        Mr Huber presided over the 45-minute service attended by about 120 friends and relatives.
        
        "We are here to support a family that has been placed under a terrible burden," Mr Huber said.
        
        "Today your love is hurting. Deep loss, anger, an evil action that cannot be understood all weigh heavily upon your heart."
        
        Mr Johnson's mother, Delores Johnson, was presented with an American flag by a family friend. Attendees sang hymns and God Bless America.
        
        The family statement read by Mr Huber called for some good to come from the shocking murder.
        
        "When history is written on the war on terrorism, let Paul's death be the catalyst that led to thousands more Westerners working in harmony with people in the Middle East to ensure fear and barbaric acts against free peoples come to an end."
        
        But authorities are warning of an anti-Arab backlash not seen since the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks.
        
        Much of the graffiti has been in small towns in New Jersey, including Egg Harbor Township and Mr Johnson's home of Eaglewood. Two mosques in Florida were vandalised and scrawled with graffiti, which included "Kill all Muslims".
        
        In Texas, dead fish were dumped in a mosque still being constructed and in St Louis a Mosque was spray-painted with a swastika and "Die".
        
        Bottles were thrown at a New Jersey mosque while congregants were inside mourning the car crash death of a teenager.
        
        "If they are throwing empty bottles today, they could be throwing rocks or worse, shooting at us tomorrow," said Aref Assaf, of the American Arab anti-Discrimination Committee.

    textlede: Barbaric tactic rears its ugly head
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        THE beheading of South Korean translator Kim Sun-il suggests the emergence of a new phase in the war against terror. Beheadings are not new. But their impact is considerably enhanced by instant, worldwide communications.
        
        The pressure on governments and individuals is considerable and such acts are difficult to prevent. Terrorist motives are mixed and the likely reaction by governments uncertain.
        
        Beheadings by Islamic militants have occurred in recent times in distant conflicts such as Algeria, Chechnya and Kashmir. Three Britons and a New Zealander, for instance, were beheaded in Chechnya in 1998. In May 2001 several hostages, including an American, were beheaded by the Al-Qaeda linked Abu Sayyaf group in the Philippines.
        
        More recently, The Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl was killed in Pakistan.
        
        The more recent murders, however, assume an almost ritualistic process.
        
        The victim is snatched, shown bound and menaced by gunmen and killed several days later. The bloody images are then posted on the Internet.
        
        The result has been widespread condemnation and revulsion.
        
        In part this is because the victims have not been combatants and are perceived to be innocent of any wrongdoing. The sheer barbarity of such a calculated act also remains more vivid than other images of death and mutilation.
        
        Nor is this condemnation restricted to non-Muslim people. Few Muslim scholars believe the Koran sanctions beheading, and only the most extremist regimes accept the practice.
        
        The Saudi Government, which had 52 men and one woman beheaded last year, would argue that such an act is only undertaken when it conforms to strict legal procedure in which the victim may be granted leniency if there is a confession and declaration of allegiance to the Islamic faith.
        
        Certainly there is no room for summary execution.
        
        So what do the militants hope to achieve? Are these acts part of a broad strategy or the actions of individual groups operating on their own terms?
        
        The group led by the Jordanian Palestinian Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, which was also responsible for beheading US hostage Nick Berg and the murder of Iraqi Governing Council head Ezzedine Salim, reportedly carried out the execution of Kim Sun-il.
        
        This group is reported to have ties with Al-Qaeda and shares its ideology.
        
        A group calling itself Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula killed Paul Johnson, the Lockheed Martin employee, in Saudi Arabia.
        
        His executioners were responsible for at least four other attacks, including the incidents in Yanbu and Khobar last month and a car bomb attack on a Saudi police station in Riyadh in April.
        
        Both groups, therefore, share a broad strategy that seeks to install an extreme form of Islamic government in all Muslim countries. This process has a number of components, including the withdrawal of the US from the Middle East and control of Saudi oil wealth.
        
        But it is the acceptance of a general strategy, which draws them together, and not adherence to a common, detailed plan. Only a fully functioning Al-Qaeda could have mandated such an outcome and Osama bin Laden is in no position to do that.
        
        IN POLITICAL and psychological terms there probably are three main targets. The first is the US and those governments that support Washington in its war against terror. Public beheadings are meant to pressure governments to withdraw support and to isolate Washington. Where governments are obdurate, they seek to galvanise public opinion and to exploit those elements that oppose the war in Iraq.
        
        The second target is the foreign workforce on which Iraqi reconstruction and the Saudi oil industry are so dependent. In Saudi Arabia more than 30 foreign workers have been killed since early May. Although there is clearly no major exodus at this time, the withdrawal of foreign workers would weaken US-Saudi ties and leave the oil industry in Saudi hands. While this could lead to a serious decline in oil production, and could jeopardise Al-Qaeda funding, it would be seen as a major blow to the West.
        
        The final group represents the militants themselves, their supporters and potential recruits. Al-Qaeda already enjoys considerable support and is seen as the only organisation capable of resisting the US and replacing the repressive and dictatorial regimes of the Middle East. Public executions are seen as bold, merciless and vengeful. They are also seen as an act of strength that defies the overwhelming military capacity of the Western world to prevent these acts happening.
        
        The impact on governments is mixed. The South Korean reaction is probably indicative of many. While all sides of the political process condemn the outcome, it has reinforced the divisions between those who supported the deployment of troops and those who opposed it.
        
        Unfortunately, the terrorists tend to see only those actions that support their cause, and the likelihood of more beheadings is high.

    textlede: Al-Qaida names new leader in Saudi Arabia
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        RIYADH, Saudi Arabia _ Days after its last leader was killed by police, Saudi Arabia's al-Qaida network is regrouping under its new chief, policeman-turned-terrorist Saleh Mohammed al-Aoofi, and is likely to continue its brutal assault on Westerners despite a massive government crackdown.
        
        Al-Aoofi, who once sang to his mother about joining the Islamic holy war, reportedly knows bin Laden and other leading al-Qaida figures. And his expertise in security, say experts in Saudi terrorism, may make him even more effective than his predecessor, Abdulaziz al-Moqrin, who ordered the beheading of kidnapped American Paul Johnson.
        
        The group posted a Web site statement over the weekend saying security forces participated in Johnson's abduction, a claim vigorously dismissed by the Saudi government. Authorities were continuing their search for Johnson's body on Monday amid an intense crackdown on suspected terrorist strongholds.
        
        Johnson, a 49-year-old Lockheed Martin worker who was kidnapped on June 12, was beheaded by his al-Qaida captors last week. Al-Moqrin and three top lieutenants were killed hours later in a shootout with security forces in an east central Riyadh neighborhood.
        
        While al-Moqrin's death was a major blow against the Saudi branch of al Qaida, the terrorist cell moved quickly to try to reassert itself by announcing al-Aoofi as its fourth leader in a year. The group, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, also claimed that Johnson's captors stopped him at a phony police checkpoint, using uniforms and police cars provided by security forces.
        
        Al-Aoofi has consistently ranked among the top five, eventually rising to number three, on the list of the 26 most wanted terrorists sought by the government since December 2003. Nine have been killed, and a tenth surrendered.
        
        Under its new leader, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula is expected to persist in its fundamental goal of destabilizing the royal family and ridding Saudi Arabia of foreigners. More than 5 million expatriates, including an estimated 30,000 Americans, are scattered throughout Saudi Arabia.
        
        "When you have your head man killed, that could do a lot of damage, but they will still continue to do terrorist attacks," said Abdulmuhsin al Akkas, a senior member of the government's legislative council.
        
        "You must understand _ these people are fanatics."
        
        Ben Venzke, whose company, IntelCenter of Alexandria, Va., conducts intelligence analyses for the U.S. government, said the group will continue to target Americans and may carry out further brutal executions to draw attention to itself. The al-Qaida cell may also target individual members of the Saudi royal family and will likely attempt to carry out an earlier threat to go after the Saudi oil industry and Western airlines.
        
        Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula is the dominant terrorist organization in Saudi Arabia, said Venzke, IntelCenter's chief executive officer.
        
        According to a profile by the reform-oriented Saudi Institute of Washington, D.C., al-Aoofi is a former police officer who was born in the holy city of Medina. He joined terrorist networks in Afghanistan and Bosnia, where he was injured, and returned to Saudi Arabia in 1995.
        
        Under al-Moqrin, al-Aoofi kept a low profile and ran secret al-Qaida camps in Saudi Arabia. He was essentially responsible for training, recruitment and logistics.
        
        He also met with Osama bin Laden before the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States, according to the Institute, attributing its information to intelligence sources.
        
        The Saudi Institute said it had also obtained a recording of al-Aoofi singing to his mother about his decision to join "the holy war."
        
        Mohsen al Awajy, a political activist in Riyadh who tried unsuccessfully to negotiate an end to the terrorist campaign, said he met al-Aoofi more than a year ago. Al-Aoofi, he recalled, "was fully charged with anger against any smell of the United States."
        
        "He may lead this group into more bloodshed," al Awajy warned.
        
        In 1995, according to accounts in the Saudi press, al-Aoofi established a car dealership that authorities suspected may have been used for terrorist money laundering.
        
        In 2002, after he became a leading suspect in Saudi-based terrorist circles, al-Aoofi tried to return to the kingdom for his father's funeral, disguised as a woman. A report in the Arab News said he was rejected by his tribe because he incited extremism among the tribe's young people.
        
        Unlike the more flamboyant al-Moqrin, who often used the Internet to espouse inflammatory rhetoric, the new leader may be more deliberate and calculating, said Ali al Ahmed, director of the Saudi Institute. He is also adept at recruiting disaffected young people from economically depressed areas, said al Ahmed.
        
        "He is older and more in tune with the country than al-Moqrin," said al Ahmed.

        DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia
        
        Days after its leader was killed by police, Saudi Arabia's al-Qaeda network is regrouping under a new chief, former policeman Saleh al-Aufi.
        
        Despite a government crackdown now under way in this desert kingdom, the network is likely to continue its brutal assault on Westerners.

    textlede: Obituary: Abd al-Aziz al-Muqrin: Al-Qaida mastermind behind Saudi killings
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Abd al-Aziz al-Muqrin, who has been killed, aged 31, by security forces in the Saudi capital Riyadh, was the putative head of al-Qaida in Saudi Arabia. While both Saudi and US authorities have hailed his death as a blow against the militants, some experts believe that he was merely the charismatic figurehead of the movement in the kingdom. Analysts with the US-based Stratfor Intelligence described him as "the face, not the brain \.\.\. important but replaceable".
        
        However, among the attacks attributed to Muqrin - all in Saudi Arabia - were the suicide bombing of Riyadh housing compounds on Nov- ember 8 2003, in which 17 people were killed; a suicide car bombing of the Riyadh police headquarters in April, killing four; and the shooting dead of six people, including two Americans, in the Red Sea port city of Yanbu. One of the bodies was dragged behind a car past a school.
        
        Then, on May 29, another group of gunmen under Muqrin's command took hostages in the eastern Saudi oil hub of Khobar; 22 people were killed after a shootout, including nine whose throats were slit by their abductors. The beheading of the American hostage Paul Johnson last week, also attributed to Muqrin, came hours before his own death, when it was reported that he had been surrounded after dumping the US engineer's body.
        
        At the time of his death, Muqrin was the most wanted man in Saudi Arabia. With a flair for self-publicity and braggadocio on various internet sites, both his rise to fame and his sudden demise were meteoric and bloody. He had only begun to be spoken of as head of al-Qaida in the Arabian peninsula in March, after Saudi police shot dead his Yemeni-born predecessor, Khaled Ali bin Ali Haj.
        
        In reality, though, Muqrin had devoted more than half his life to the radical Islamist cause. He was born in the teeming, conservative Al-Suwaydi district of Riyadh, whose half million inhabitants are mostly poor migrants to the metropolis from the once-Bedouin hinterland. Al-Suwaydi is where, on June 6, Muqrin reportedly orchestrated the attack that seriously wounded the BBC security correspondent Frank Gard-ner and killed his Irish-born cameraman Simon Cumbers (obituary, June 8).
        
        At 17, the slightly built, but angry and ambitious Muqrin dropped out of school to join the "global jihad". He travelled to Afghanistan, where he received al-Qaida training and apparently came under the personal sway of Osama Bin Laden, a fellow Saudi. In the 1990s, he was reportedly sent to Algeria, where he apparently smuggled in arms from Spain and perfected the now common custom of videoing gruesome atrocities.
        
        He later went to Bosnia, working as a trainer in a military camp; a website picture released at the weekend showed him posing, in winter camouflage kit, with a US-made Stinger hand-held missile launcher, in the snows, presumably of the Balkans. He is also understood to have been in Somalia, where he fought against Ethiopa in the Ogaden, and in Yemen.
        
        Muqrin was arrested in Ethiopia in 1995 and accused of taking part in a botched assassination attempt on the visiting Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak. He spent two years in an Ethiopian prison before being deported to a Saudi jail. He was sentenced to eight years, though this was halved, and he was released in summer 2001, after impressing his guards by memorising the entire Koran. Curiously, despite his notoriety, he did not appear on the FBI's list of its 22 most wanted terrorists.
        
        Back in Afghanistan in late 2001, Muqrin fought against the US-led coalition. By 2002, he had slipped back into Saudi Arabia, and, in late 2003, found himself at the top of a Saudi list of 26 most wanted insurgents. Elusive and lucky, he evaded numerous dragnets; eulogisers said he was hiding in the desert, surviving on berries and rainwater.
        
        Meanwhile, the US-led invasion of Iraq last year, and subsequent events, inflamed radical Islamists and galvanised al-Qaida in Saudi Arabia. Muqrin's fighting experience and proficiency in explosives and tactics commended him to the group's shadowy leaders.
        
        That said, he had surprised seasoned al-Qaida-watchers by developing a cult of personality. An internet broadcast he made on April 27 threatened "fierce" attacks against Jews, Americans and western interests in the Middle East, and swore to turn 2004 into a "year of misery" - but, unlike Bin Laden, Muqrin boasted about his actions.
        
        Tactically, Muqrin appears to have favoured isolated cells, guerrilla insurgency raids and car bombings over suicide attacks. Strategically, he differed from Bin Laden in concentrating on violence within the Saudi kingdom itself. In a sense, he brought the revolution back to its roots, although he also threatened more European atrocities, similar to the Madrid bombings. A net-borne memo in Mugrin's name unusually listed targets, and promised a "military diplomacy written in blood and decorated with body pieces".
        
        He is survived by a wife and daughter, whom he had abandoned at the age of 23.

    textlede: Report: Saudi forces aided hostage's death

    textoriginal: |
        RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- The al-Qaida group responsible for beheading an American engineer said sympathizers in the Saudi security forces provided police uniforms and cars used during the victim's kidnapping, according to an Islamic extremist Web site Sunday.
        
        The account of the abduction of Paul M. Johnson Jr., who was later decapitated, highlighted the fears expressed by some diplomats and Westerners in the kingdom that militants have infiltrated Saudi security forces -- a possibility Saudi officials have denied.
        
        The article recounting the abduction appeared in Sawt al-Jihad, or Voice of the Holy War, a semimonthly Internet periodical posted by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula -- the group that claimed responsibility for killing Johnson.
        
        According to the account, militants wearing police uniforms and using police cars set up a fake checkpoint June 12 on al-Khadma Road, leading to the airport, near Imam Mohammed bin Saud University.
        
        "A number of the cooperators who are sincere to their religion in the security apparatus donated those clothes and the police cars. We ask God to reward them and that they use their energy to serve Islam and the mujahedeen," the article read.
        
        When Johnson's car approached the checkpoint, the militants stopped it, detained him, anesthetized him and carried him to another car, the article said. Earlier Saudi newspaper reports said Johnson was drugged during the kidnapping.
        
        In a separate article on the Web site, the leader of the al-Qaida cell behind the abduction, Abdulaziz al-Moqrin, justified the targeting of Johnson, pointing to his work on Apache attack helicopters for Lockheed Martin. Al-Moqrin and three other militants were killed Friday in a shootout with Saudi security forces hours after Johnson's death became known.
        
        Johnson "works for military aviation and he belongs to the American army, which kills, tortures and harms Muslims everywhere, which supports enemies [of Islam] in Palestine, Philippines, Kashmir," wrote al-Moqrin.
        
        On Sunday, police continued their search for Johnson's body and the militants involved in his death.
        
        "We are still combing through neighborhoods. And we hope that eventually we'll find the body and restore it to his family," Adel al-Jubeir, the foreign affairs adviser of Crown Prince Abdullah in Washington, said on CNN's "Late Edition."
        
        Police cars, armored vehicles and a large contingent of emergency forces blockaded the al-Malaz area Sunday in a search for suspects, security officials said. Witnesses saw suspects fleeing into a house in the neighborhood after police fired at them at a traffic light.
        
        Hours later, the blockade was lifted and security forces left. It was unclear whether anyone was arrested.
        
        On Sunday night, scores of Saudi men, mostly in their 20s and 30s, paid visits to the gas station where al-Moqrin and the three others were killed.
        
        "This should be turned into a national monument," said Mohamed Ibrahim Shakir.
        
        "Every Saudi should come here and pray to God. We got rid of these terrorists."
        
        The men counted more than two dozen bullet holes in the facade of the run-down shop. Shopkeeper Ibrahim al-Shamari said the militant leader was shooting at security forces from behind a refrigerator when he was killed.
        
        "Every Saudi should be proud of this. I should have brought my wife and children to see the end of this man," Khalil bin Othman said.
        
        One security officer was killed and two were wounded in the shootout, the official Saudi news agency reported.
        
        Al-Moqrin is believed to have had a leading role in the stepped-up campaign of militant violence in the kingdom, which in recent months has seen bombings and gun attacks on foreigners.
        
        Saudi King Fahd said Sunday that militants would not succeed in their aim to harm the kingdom.
        
        "The perpetrators of these attacks aimed at shaking stability and crippling security -- and it is a far-fetched aim, God willing," he said in a speech to the advisory Shura Council.
        
        "We will not allow this destructive bunch, led by deviant thought, to harm the security of this nation or affect its stability."
        
        Johnson was seized June 12, the same day Islamic militants shot and killed Kenneth Scroggs of Laconia, N.H., in his garage in Riyadh. Earlier that week, militants in the capital also shot and killed Irish cameraman Simon Cumbers, who was filming for the British Broadcasting Corp., and another American, Robert Jacobs, of Murphysboro, Ill.
        
        Johnson's captors said they would kill him on Friday unless Saudi Arabia released jailed al-Qaida militants.
        
        Sunday's al-Qaida article said the militants decided to behead Johnson when Adel al-Jubeir, foreign affairs adviser to Crown Prince Abdullah in Washington, declared that Saudi Arabia would not negotiate with the kidnappers.
        
        "The stupid Saudi government took the initiative and announced by the Americanized tongue Adel Al-Jubeir that it will not submit to the conditions of the mujahedeen," the statement read.
        
        The group said it beheaded Johnson, 49, of Eagleswood Township, N.J., when its deadline expired Friday.
        
        Asked about the al-Qaida statement on CNN's "Late Edition," al-Jubeir said, "We have never negotiated with terrorists. We don't intend to do so.
        
        "I believe what the al-Qaida people were trying to do is trying to justify a murder that is unjustifiable under any faith or under any principle of humanity."

    textlede: Saudi forces kill top al-Qaida figure; Four rebels die after US hostage beheaded
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        AL-QAIDA'S cell in Saudi Arabia confirmed at the weekend that its leader Abdulaziz al-Moqrin was among four militants who died in a gun battle with security forces on Friday night.
        
        The group, which calls itself al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, has claimed responsibility for a number of recent attacks on Westerners, including the beheading of US hostage Paul Johnson on Friday night.
        
        The gunfight with the militants in the capital Riyadh occurred soon after the group had posted photographs of Mr Johnson's decapitated body on the internet.
        
        In an internet statement, the group said that the four militants had been killed "when the soldiers of the tyrants set up a trap for them."
        
        The statement identified the other three militants as Faisal Abdul-Rahman al-Dikheel, Turki bin Fuheid al-Muteiry and Ibrahim bin Abdullah alDreiham.
        
        "The mojahedin are continuing the jihad that they have pledged to God and the killing of their brothers will not weaken their resolve but only increase their determination and commitment, " the statement said.
        
        Saudi ruler Crown Prince Abdullah's foreign affairs adviser Adel al-Jubeir said that Mr Dikheel was believed to have been the No 2 al-Qaida militant in the country.
        
        A Saudi Press Agency statement said that Mr Dikheel had been involved in a number of killings and apparently featured in video footage of Mr Johnson's killing.
        
        According to the agency, Mr Muteiry was among militants who fled the scene of the May 29 shooting and hostage-taking attack in the oil city of Khobar that killed 22 people and Mr Dreiham was linked to the November 2003 suicide bombing at Riyadh housing compounds that claimed 17 lives.
        
        Mr Johnson was seized on June 12, the same day that Islamist militants shot and killed fellow US citizen Kenneth Scroggs.
        
        Interior Minister Prince Nayef sought to reassure Saudis on Saturday that the government would eradicate terrorism.
        
        "The state is strong in crushing the enemy and will cleanse the country, " he said.
        
        Yet many remained sceptical about the kingdom's ability to stamp out terrorism.
        
        US ambassador James Oberwetter praised the Saudi security forces for their work, but he added that Saudi Arabia remains a dangerous place for Westerners.
        
        Mr Jubeir acknowledged that there are probably more terror cells in the country besides the one led by Mr Moqrin.
        
        And Cairo expert on Islamist militants Dia'a Rashwan said that Saudi Arabia's conservative Islamic traditions make it fertile ground for extremism.
        
        Police in armoured vehicles and a helicopter closed off three Riyadh neighbourhoods yesterday in a pre-dawn search for more Islamic extremists and Mr Johnson's body.

        Algeria kills militant leader linked to al-Qaida
        
        ALGIERS, Algeria - Troops killed one of North Africa's most wanted Islamic militants, who had sought to link his bloody insurgent movement in Algeria to Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida terror network, the military said Sunday.
        
        The death of Nabil Sahraoui, head of the Salafist Group for Call and Combat, marked a major victory for Algerian government efforts to suppress Islamic militant violence and left his armed extremist organization with no clear leader.
        
        Sahraoui and three of his lieutenants were killed in a vast antiterrorist operation that continues in the Kabylie region east of the capital, Algiers, the army general staff said in a statement. Newspaper reports said Sahraoui was killed late Thursday or Friday.
        
        The Salafist Group, known by its French acronym GSPC, is one of two groups that have led a violent insurgency against Algeria's military-backed government since 1992.
        
        It and the Armed Islamic Group, from which it split in 1998, are blamed for bombings, rapes and massacres. But the Salafists have been diminished in recent months under government offensives.
        
        Sahraoui, who was in his mid to late 30s, took over leadership of the Salafist group last year and declared its allegiance to al-Qaida.

    textlede: Saudis shut down key al-Qaeda cell as 12 more suspects caught in dragnet
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        BERLIN - Saudi security forces killed four al-Qaeda members in a shootout and launched a dragnet in Riyadh that captured 12 others in the aftermath of the beheading of an American defence contractor, Saudi officials said Saturday.
        
        Saudi authorities said that the four militants, who were on a list of most-wanted terrorism suspects, were killed late Friday just after the group, calling itself al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, distributed a video depicting the headless body of Paul M. Johnson Jr., 49, an employee of Lockheed Martin Corp. Johnson, who was kidnapped six days earlier, was one of three American military contractors slain in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, in the past two weeks.
        
        In Riyadh, Saudi television aired footage of the battered bodies of the militants whom authorities said died in a shootout at a Riyadh gas station. Among them was Abdulaziz Moqrin, the leader of the al-Qaeda cell.
        
        The security operation deactivated most of the cell, which was responsible for a number recent attacks in Saudi Arabia, the officials said. The Saudi Interior Ministry said the militants had been involved in several terrorist attacks in the past seven months, including the Nov. 9 bombing of a foreigners' residential compound in Riyadh and the slaying of 22 people last month at another compound for foreigners.
        
        The ministry said police had separately seized a car used by gunmen who fatally shot a BBC cameraman and critically wounded a BBC correspondent in Riyadh on June 6. In addition, the officials said one of those arrested was a suspected planner of the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen.
        
        Saudi officials said the security operation had severely weakened the capabilities of Islamic extremists who began operations 13 months ago in the country, adding that Moqrin's group was the only known al-Qaeda cell remaining in the country. But they stopped short of declaring the kingdom a safe place for the 35,000 Americans and other foreigners who work and live there, cautioning that more attacks were possible.
        
        "We will continue our hunt for others in the kingdom who are members of this evil group or who may be supporters of this group," Adel Jubeir, foreign policy adviser to Crown Prince Abdullah, said at a news conference in Washington.
        
        "We will show no mercy."
        
        Since March, when Moqrin declared himself the new leader of al-Qaeda operations in Saudi Arabia, he had taunted the Saudi royal family for its inability to find him or his followers.
        
        Ramzi Khouri, an editorial director of the Saudi Gazette newspaper, described Moqrin as a charismatic outlaw with a flair for public relations.
        
        "Al-Qaeda needs to make it very personal, to create these symbols who can become very popular with the public, like Osama bin Laden," Khouri said in a telephone interview from Jiddah.
        
        "Moqrin was one heck of a speaker. ... He was becoming a hero to many people. If he had been able to keep going for a while, he have become another Che Guevara."
        
        At the same time, Khouri said the al-Qaeda leader's death would not end the uprising.
        
        "They have not gotten rid of al-Qaeda by any means. There are more people from where this cell came from."
        
        Officials said reports that Johnson's body had been recovered were incorrect, adding late Saturday that they were still looking for his remains. But they said a video showing his decapitated corpse was genuine and that they had no doubt he was dead.

    textlede: Saudis kill hostage's executioners
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        The killing of the mastermind of recent terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia might be a critical achievement in the kingdom's efforts to combat the al-Qaida terrorist network, but the US ambassador and analysts doubt the setback will swiftly halt the terrorists' campaign against Westerners.
        
        Saudi Arabia announced Saturday that it had killed Abdulaziz al-Moqrin, considered the leader of al-Qaida in Saudi Arabia, and three other terrorists in a clash with security forces in Riyadh hours after the group broadcast grisly photographs of beheaded American hostage Paul M. Johnson Jr. on an Internet site.
        
        US and Saudi officials said Johnson's body had not been found.
        
        Adel al-Jubeir, foreign affairs adviser to Crown Prince Abdullah in Washington, said they were looking for the body on the northern outskirts of the capital, and Saudi security officials said they have been searching in desert areas around Riyadh. They said they were also searching houses and apartments that they suspect were used by terrorists.
        
        Abdullah told a strikingly different story about who was to blame: "Zionism is behind it. It has become clear now. It has become clear to us. I don't say, I mean... It is not 100 percent, but 95% that the Zionist hands are behind what happened," he said in a tape obtained by NBC News.
        
        Other senior Saudi officials reaffirmed the claim that supporters of Israel - Zionists - were behind the terrorist attacks.
        
        Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef said, "Al-Qaida is backed by Israel and Zionism."
        
        Barry Rubin, the director of the Global Research Center in International Affairs at the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya, said that Abdullah's comments are nothing new, and indeed an exact repetition of what the Saudi leader said just two weeks ago.
        
        Rubin said that while Abdullah might indeed believe his statement, it is doubtful the Saudi people will buy the claims.
        
        "I think the Saudi people realize that extreme Muslims are behind the attacks," he said.
        
        "They can believe that Jews are behind the September 11 attacks, because the US is a long way away, and they don't understand American society. But they know that in Saudi Arabia extreme Muslims have been recruiting people."
        
        Rubin said that whether or not Abdullah believes his own comments, by continuing to be unwilling to face the truth that the Saudi regime is now being attacked by products of its own ideology and system, the crown prince is indeed endangering the future of his regime.
        
        As ludicrous as Abdullah's comments are, Rubin said, they do have their own internal logic.
        
        "He wants to show that the people behind the attacks are the worst possible people, not only aren't they really Muslims, but they are the worst enemies of Muslims; therefore they must be Zionists."
        
        Rubin said that the Saudis have also said recently that Zionists are giving money to Saudi opposition groups in London, and that these groups are the ones behind the attacks on Saudi soil.
        
        Rubin said the comments by Abdullah, who effectively is in control of Saudi Arabia, is just another example of how deep the hate toward Israel runs, and how difficult it will be to make peace in the region, especially with the Saudis.
        
        Adel Al-Jubeir, foreign policy adviser to Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah, said security forces who had been scouring the capital for days, using moving roadblocks, found the car carrying Moqrin and his colleagues in Riyadh's al-Malaz neighborhood Friday night. A gun battle erupted and lasted for several hours, as "the terrorists tried to shoot their way out," he said.
        
        One security officer was killed and two were wounded in the gun battle, the official Saudi Press Agency reported. The Interior Ministry said 12 suspected terrorists were also arrested in a sweep of the capital during the night.
        
        SPA identified the three other killed terrorists as Faisal Abdul-Rahman al-Dikheel, Turki bin Fuheid al- Muteiry, and Ibrahim bin Abdullah al-Dreiham.
        
        Saudi TV broadcast pictures Saturday of four bloodied bodies it said were the terrorists, apparently to refute denials by Islamic militants that Moqrin was dead. A posting on an Islamist Web site Saturday said claims of Moqrin's death were "aimed at dissuading the holy warriors and crushing their spirits."
        
        According to the SPA statement, Dikheel - also on the kingdom's list of the top 26 wanted militants - was involved in a number of killings and apparently was featured in video footage of Johnson's killing. Muteiry was among the terrorists to flee the scene of the May 29 shooting and hostage-taking attack on the oil hub of Khobar that killed 22 people and Dreiham was linked to the November 8, 2003, suicide bombing at Riyadh housing compounds that killed 17, the statement added.
        
        The Interior Ministry said authorities had confiscated three cars used by Moqrin's cell, including one believed to have been used in the June 6 killing of Irish cameraman Simon Cumbers.
        
        Also confiscated were forged identity papers, $38,000, and a weapons cache, including three rocket-propelled grenade launchers, hand grenades, and automatic rifles, the statement said.
        
        The killing of Johnson, 49, who had worked in Saudi Arabia for more than a decade, was the latest of targeted attacks against Westerners in the kingdom despite an intense government crackdown on militants.
        
        Crown Prince Abdullah, the de facto ruler, and other top officials have said the crackdown is the beginning of the end of terrorism in the kingdom that has killed scores of people and scared some foreigners away from the oil-rich nation.
        
        Yet many remained skeptical about Saudi Arabia's ability to end terrorism.
        
        US Ambassador James C. Oberwetter praised Saudi security forces for their work, including the killing of Moqrin - "among the most vicious of the current al-Qaida thugs on the peninsula" - but said Saudi Arabia will remain a dangerous place for a while.
        
        "A great deal was accomplished last evening but we also believe that much more remains to be done," Oberwetter said at a press conference Saturday.
        
        "The Saudis are doing an excellent job working on their most wanted list and taking people of that list," he said.
        
        "But not everyone has been removed from the list. Maybe there are more."
        
        He said the situation in the kingdom remains dangerous for Westerners.
        
        "It will be some time before we achieve a comfort level that the situation returns to normal," he said.
        
        Al-Jubeir acknowledged that there are likely more terror cells in the kingdom besides the one headed by Moqrin.
        
        "We have substantially weakened the organization. ... We will continue to pursue them with vigor until we eliminate them from our midst," he said.
        
        Saudi analysts have estimated that there are some 2,000 terrorists in the kingdom who might have links with Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida terror network or its sympathizers.
        
        Dia'a Rashwan, a Cairo expert on Islamic terrorists, said the death of Moqrin will not end terrorism in Saudi Arabia, where he said the conservative Islamic traditions makes it fertile ground for extremism.
        
        "There are always new generations who can take over and continue their course," he said.
        
        Moqrin took over al-Qaida operations in the kingdom after his predecessor, Khaled Ali Haj, was killed by security agents earlier this year, but he had masterminded attacks before that. Haj succeeded Youssef al-Airi, who was killed in a clash with Saudi security forces in early 2003.
        
        Rashwan said, however, that the replacement terrorists may lack the combat skills and expertise of their predecessors, who, like Moqrin, trained in Afghanistan and elsewhere.
        
        Moqrin, known as a smart and brutal tactician, was the most-wanted terrorist in Saudi Arabia. His attacks in recent months have shown tactical flexibility - devastating car bombs as well as pinpointed strikes like the kidnapping of Johnson, a first in the kingdom.
        
        Johnson was kidnapped last weekend by militants who threatened to kill him by Friday if the kingdom did not release its al-Qaida prisoners. The Saudi government rejected the demands.
        
        Three photos of Johnson's body, the head severed, were posted on the Internet as the deadline ran out.
        
        A statement, in the name of Fallujah Brigade of al- Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, said that "the infidel got his fair treatment. ...Let him taste something of what Muslims have long tasted from Apache helicopter fire and missiles."
        
        Johnson had worked on Apache helicopters for Lockheed Martin.
        
        Johnson was seized June 12, the same day that Islamic militants shot and killed Kenneth Scroggs of Laconia, New Hampshire, in his garage in Riyadh. Earlier that week, terrorists in the capital shot and killed another American, Robert Jacobs of Murphysboro, Illinois, and Irishman Cumbers.

    textlede: Brutal, evil, barbaric, horrendous, cowardly; World leaders condemn US hostage beheading
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        IN a move which underscored the sickening nature of terrorist violence, al-Qaeda militants in Saudi Arabia beheaded American hostage Paul Johnson early yesterday.
        
        The act, which was published in graphic detail on the internet, was immediately condemned throughout the world in some of the strongest language heard thus far.
        
        And Saudi forces quickly took action in retaliation, shooting dead the leader of the kidnappers as he tried to dispose of the body.
        
        Abdulaziz al-Muqrin's group posted photographs of the 49-year-old aviation engineer's severed head on a website, six days after he was seized. The Saudi Government had refused to free Islamist prisoners by the deadline set by the cell.
        
        Shortly afterwards, as Muqrin and two other top militants tried to deposit Mr Johnson's body in the capital Riyadh, they were surrounded by Saudi security men and gunned down, a Saudi security source said.
        
        Washington immediately stepped up its warnings to US citizens.
        
        The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Canberra said travel advisory warnings for Australians in Saudi Arabia had not changed.
        
        Existing advice provides detailed warnings and suggests "Australians in Saudi Arabia concerned for their security should consider departure".
        
        Muqrin, an angry young man driven by revenge and hatred for the US and its Arab allies, was Saudi Arabia's most wanted al-Qaeda leader. His death will be portrayed as a major blow to Saudi-born Osama bin Laden by the kingdom's rulers, once chided by their US allies as being soft on terrorism.
        
        "This is a very prompt and telling demonstration of their [Saudi] commitment to defeating al-Qaeda," a US State Department official said.
        
        "We are going to see justice is done."
        
        Mr Johnson was the third American killed in Riyadh in the past 10 days, increasing pressure on thousands of US citizens and other foreigners vital to the economy of the world's biggest oil exporter and on the Saudi royal family, which bin Laden has sworn to overthrow for its close alliance with Washington.
        
        "They're trying to get us to retreat from the world. America will not retreat," said President George Bush, who declared war on al-Qaeda after a mainly Saudi group attacked the US on September 11 three years ago.
        
        "America will not be intimidated by these kinds of extremist thugs."
        
        Vice President Dick Cheney said: "America will hunt down the killers one by one and destroy them."
        
        The US embassy said more attacks were likely and the State Department warned Americans of a risk of violence across the Gulf region after urging many to leave Saudi Arabia this week.
        
        Other world leaders described the attack as evil, barbaric, horrendous and cowardly.
        
        "As we promised the mujahideen, we have beheaded the American hostage Paul Marshall after the deadline that the mujahideen gave to the tyrannical Saudi government passed," the Falluja Brigade of the Organisation of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula
        
        said on its website, using Mr Johnson's first names.
        
        Scarcely had it appeared than Muqrin and fellow fugitives, named by Al-Arabiya television as brothers Faisal and Bandar al-Dakheel , were gunned down in the al-Malaz area of Riyadh.
        
        Special forces backed by helicopters combed al-Malaz into the night. They earlier stormed a building, searching it and making arrests before clashing with Muqrin and his comrades.
        
        The website carried three pictures of what looked like Mr Johnson's severed head one showed the bloodied head propped up on the back of a body in an orange, US prison-style jumpsuit with a knife leaning on the moustachioed face.
        
        Militant attacks have afflicted the birthplace of Islam for more than a year, but this was the first such kidnapping in Saudi Arabia and raised concerns of a new tactic. Two other Americans and an Irish cameraman have been shot dead in Riyadh this month.
        
        Beheading prisoners or cutting their throats has been a shock tactic among al-Qaeda militants for some time American Nick Berg was filmed as he was killed in Iraq last month, as was Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl in Pakistan in 2002.
        
        Like Mr Johnson, his captors dressed Berg in orange, the colour worn by al-Qaeda suspects held by US forces at Guantanamo Bay.
        
        Mr Johnson worked for defence contractor Lockheed Martin in the manufacture of Apache helicopter gunships an employment that his killers cited as justifying his selection for killing.
        
        The statement said al-Qaeda had killed him because of "what Muslims have suffered from American Apache planes and their rockets". Falluja, whose name appears in the group's signature, is a city in Iraq where US troops have fought insurgents.
        
        "This act is to heal the hearts of believers in Palestine, Afghanistan, Iraq and the Arabian Peninsula," the group's statement said, warning Americans they would meet the same fate.
        
        Earlier, Mr Johnson's family had pleaded for his life. In his home town in New Jersey the family remained out of sight. But neighbours were angry. One woman said the US would be justified in killing Saudi prisoners in retaliation.
        
        "We should start eliminating prisoners like they do ours," Connie Kennedy said.

    textlede: Saudis Kill 4 Al Qaeda Militants; 12 Suspects Seized In Sweeping Raids
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Saudi security forces killed four al Qaeda members in a shootout and launched a dragnet in Riyadh that captured 12 others in the aftermath of the beheading of an American defense contractor, Saudi officials said Saturday.
        
        Saudi authorities said that the four militants, who were on a list of most-wanted terrorism suspects, were killed late Friday just after the group, calling itself al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, distributed a video depicting the headless body of Paul M. Johnson Jr., 49, an employee of Bethesda-based Lockheed Martin Corp. Johnson, who was kidnapped six days earlier, was one of three American military contractors slain in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, in the past two weeks.
        
        In Riyadh, Saudi television aired footage of the battered bodies of the militants whom authorities said died in a shootout at a Riyadh gas station. Among them was Abdulaziz Muqrin, the leader of the al Qaeda cell.
        
        The security operation deactivated most of the cell, which was responsible for a number of recent attacks in Saudi Arabia, the officials said. The Saudi Interior Ministry said that the militants had been involved in several terrorist attacks in the past seven months, including the Nov. 9 bombing of a foreigners' residential compound in Riyadh and the slaying of 22 people last month at another compound for foreigners in Khobar.
        
        The ministry said police had separately seized a car used by gunmen who fatally shot a BBC cameraman and critically wounded a BBC correspondent in Riyadh on June 6. The officials also said that one of those arrested was a suspected planner of the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen.
        
        Saudi officials said the security operation had severely weakened the capabilities of Islamic extremists who began operations 13 months ago in the country, adding that Muqrin's group was the only known al Qaeda cell remaining in the country. But they stopped short of declaring the kingdom a safe place for the 35,000 Americans and other foreigners who work and live there, cautioning that more attacks were possible.
        
        "We will continue our hunt for others in the kingdom who are members of this evil group or who may be supporters of this group," Adel Jubeir, foreign policy adviser to Crown Prince Abdullah, said at a news conference in Washington.
        
        "We will show no mercy."
        
        Since March, when Muqrin declared himself the new leader of al Qaeda operations in Saudi Arabia, he had taunted the Saudi royal family for its inability to find him or his followers. In frequent statements posted on the Internet, Muqrin suggested that his group's ability to attack and kill foreigners at will was evidence of the righteousness of its cause.
        
        Ramzi Khouri, an editorial director of the Saudi Gazette newspaper, described Muqrin as a charismatic outlaw with a flair for public relations. Muqrin took a leading role in polished video and audio files that the group posted on the Internet, offering elaborate religious justifications for the attacks on foreigners.
        
        "Al Qaeda needs to make it very personal, to create these symbols who can become very popular with the public, like Osama bin Laden," Khouri said in a telephone interview from Jiddah.
        
        "Muqrin was one heck of a speaker\.\.\. . He was becoming a hero to many people. If he had been able to keep going for a while, he have become another Che Guevara."
        
        At the same time, Khouri said the al Qaeda leader's death would not end the uprising, just as the demise of several of his predecessors at the hands of Saudi forces did little to slow the pace of the attacks.
        
        "They have not gotten rid of al Qaeda by any means," he said.
        
        "There are more people from where this cell came from."
        
        U.S. and Saudi officials said reports that Johnson's body had been recovered were incorrect, adding late Saturday that they were still looking for his remains. But they said a video showing his decapitated corpse was genuine and that they had no doubt he was dead.
        
        Johnson was kidnapped June 12, the same day that gunmen fatally shot Kenneth Scroggs, another American defense contractor who worked out of the same office in Riyadh.
        
        Muqrin's group later released a video on the Internet of a blindfolded Johnson, threatening to kill him unless the Saudi government released an unspecified number of militants from prison. Saudi officials disclosed few details about how they tracked down Muqrin. At first, authorities in Riyadh said a witness had seen a car dump Johnson's body and took down the license plate number, but Jubeir and other officials later said that was not the case.
        
        Jubeir said 15,000 Saudi security forces had swept through Riyadh block by block in their search for Johnson and his killers. Late Friday, security forces setting up a roadblock trapped Muqrin and three other militants in a car, although Jubeir said he didn't know if the confrontation occurred by happenstance or because of specific intelligence of Muqrin's whereabouts.
        
        The gunfight lasted about two hours, Jubeir said.
        
        "The terrorists tried to shoot their way out," he added. Saudi television showed broken glass, bloodstains and other evidence of the shootout at a gas station in central Riyadh.
        
        Al Qaeda acknowledged the death of Muqrin on the Internet, after an earlier claim that he was alive and well.
        
        Jubeir described one of the other dead militants, Faisal Dakheel, as the "number two al Qaeda leader in Saudi Arabia."
        
        Also killed were Turki Muteiri, one of three gunmen wanted for the May 29 attack in Khobar; and Ibrahim Dreihim, suspected of planning the suicide bombing at the Western compound in Riyadh last November, according to the official Saudi Press Agency.
        
        The dozen militants who were arrested elsewhere during the sweeps in Riyadh included Rakan Saikhan, one of the Saudi government's 26 most-wanted terrorism suspects and an alleged conspirator in the attack on the Cole, a Saudi security source said. The Interior Ministry said police also confiscated large caches of weapons, including three rocket-propelled grenade launchers, computers and $30,000 in cash.
        
        "This is a monumental blow to the cohesive operational structure of Muqrin's operation," Nawaf Obaid, a security consultant to the Saudi government, said in a telephone interview from London.
        
        The State Department has been urging Americans to leave Saudi Arabia since April, and the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh issued an even stronger warning late Thursday, saying that Americans were being shadowed by militants.
        
        On Saturday, U.S. Ambassador James C. Oberwetter said the security situation had improved but that the country remained a dangerous place.
        
        "It will be some time before we achieve a comfort level that the situation returns to normal," Oberwetter said at a news conference in Riyadh.
        
        "The Saudis are doing an excellent job working on their most-wanted list and taking people off that list\.\.\. . But not everyone has been removed from the list. Maybe there are more."

    textlede: American killed by al-Qaeda cell: Saudis claim three militants killed hours after beheading
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Islamist radicals killed an American engineer held hostage in Saudi Arabia, then posted photographs of the man's severed head and bloodied corpse on an Islamist website Friday.
        
        Hours later, Saudi security forces reported that they tracked down and killed at least three militants, including the reputed leader of a group responsible for beheading 49-year-old Paul M. Johnson Jr., a native of New Jersey.
        
        A group calling itself al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula threatened Tuesday to kill Johnson within 72 hours unless the Saudi government freed imprisoned Islamist militants. Saudi officials refused, insisting that they wouldn't negotiate with terrorists.
        
        In a statement posted with the grisly photographs, the group said, "As we promised the mujahedeen (holy warriors), we have beheaded the American hostage \.\.\. Paul Marshal after the deadline that the mujahedeen gave to the tyrannical Saudi government passed."
        
        Three pictures showed the decapitated remains of a man resembling Johnson. In one picture, a hand cradled the severed head. In another snapshot, the slain man was sprawled on his stomach, and somebody had balanced the head, face to the camera, atop his back.
        
        Later Friday, Saudi forces killed the militants' leader, Abdulaziz al-Moqrin and three others.
        
        In Washington, Saudi spokesman Adel al-Jubeir said Moqrin was killed in a fierce firefight along with two of his lieutenants and a fourth person. Three Saudi security officers also were killed in the shootout in Malaz, a mixed commercial-residential neighborhood in central Riyadh.
        
        Authorities identified one of Moqrin's lieutenants who was killed as Faisal Dakheil, an al-Qaeda operative who had been on the Saudis' most-wanted list.
        
        Johnson's death drew expressions of sorrow and condemnation from top U.S. government and business officials. President Bush said Johnson's death was part of efforts by "extremist thugs" to intimidate Americans.
        
        "The murder of Paul shows the evil nature of the enemy we face," said Bush, who spoke to reporters after a speech to troops in Fort Lewis, Wash.
        
        "These are barbaric people. There's no justification whatsoever for his murder, and yet they killed him in cold blood. And it should remind us that we must pursue these people, and bring them to justice before they hurt other Americans."
        
        The State Department issued a heightened alert Friday evening, warning U.S. citizens throughout the Middle East and North Africa that further attacks were likely.
        
        A State Department official, citing recent intelligence, said the embassy in Riyadh was urging all Americans to leave the desert kingdom.
        
        "It's terrifying when you read all the threat reporting that's out there," the official said.
        
        "It's just unreal."
        
        Johnson was kidnapped last weekend on the same day militants gunned down another American worker in his garage in Riyadh.
        
        Militants apparently targeted Johnson because he was an engineer with Lockheed Martin who specialized in Apache helicopters.
        
        "Let him taste something of what Muslims have long tasted from Apache helicopter fire and missiles," the statement posted Friday said.
        
        In the Arab world, Apache helicopters are associated with American and Israeli military strikes in Iraq and the Palestinian territories -- with fighting perceived by Islamic radicals as part of a global campaign of persecution against Muslims.
        
        After provoking popular outcry by bombing a Saudi police station earlier this spring, Saudi militants have in recent weeks picked their victims with increasing sophistication. Their attacks have included large-scale suicide bombings at housing compounds that cater to foreign workers, shooting rampages at oil industry facilities and the fatal shooting of Westerners in the streets of Riyadh.
        
        Johnson's kidnapping was the latest stroke in an increasingly vicious battle waged by Islamist militants against Saudi Arabia's royal family and the Western "infidels" who live and work in the birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad. The engineer's killing deepened the fear among foreign workers living here and echoed the outpouring of condemnation that followed the beheadings of other American captives.
        
        Nicholas Berg in Iraq and Daniel Pearl in Pakistan..
        
        "The inhumanity of the crime exceeds all boundaries of civilized peoples," U.S. Ambassador James C. Oberwetter said in a written statement.
        
        In an obvious reference to criticism of the Saudi government for failing to crack down on insurgents, Oberwetter said Saudi officials were given only three days to find Johnson in a city the size of Chicago. But he reminded the Saudi government that Americans had "helped advance the interests of Saudi Arabia," and warned that good relations between the two nations depends on the protection of American expatriates.
        
        "This has been a rough year for Americans in Saudi Arabia," Oberwetter said.
        
        "We urge the government of Saudi Arabia to continue its efforts to bring Paul's murderers to account, as well as those who have carried out other terrorist crimes in the Kingdom."

        Johnson was kidnapped last weekend on the same day militants gunned down another American worker in his garage in Riyadh.
        
        Militants apparently targeted Johnson because he was an engineer with Lockheed Martin who specialized in Apache helicopters.
        
        "Let him taste something of what Muslims have long tasted from Apache helicopter fire and missiles," the statement posted Friday said.
        
        In the Arab world, Apache helicopters are associated with American and Israeli military strikes in Iraq and the Palestinian territories -- with fighting perceived by Islamic radicals as part of a global campaign of persecution against Muslims.
        
        After provoking popular outcry by bombing a Saudi police station earlier this spring, Saudi militants have in recent weeks picked their victims with increasing sophistication. Their attacks have included large-scale suicide bombings at housing compounds that cater to foreign workers, shooting rampages at oil industry facilities and the fatal shooting of Westerners in the streets of Riyadh.
        
        Johnson's kidnapping was the latest stroke in an increasingly vicious battle waged by Islamist militants against Saudi Arabia's royal family and the Western "infidels" who live and work in the birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad. The engineer's killing deepened the fear among foreign workers living here and echoed the outpouring of condemnation that followed the beheadings of other American captives.

    textoriginal: |
        WASHINGTON - Al Qaeda leader Abdulaziz al-Muqrin rose through the terror ranks as publisher of a Web magazine called Voice of Jihad and as mastermind of a deadly attack last November in Saudi Arabia, experts said yesterday.
        
        "Muqrin has been one of the most wanted men in Saudi Arabia," said Josh Devon, a terrorism expert at the SITE Institute in Washington.
        
        "He was the head of the Al Qaeda [fighters] on the Arabian Peninsula [and] was a top recruiter and planner in the region," Devon said.
        
        Al-Muqrin and two associates were gunned down by Saudi police as they tried to dump the headless body of American engineer Paul Johnson in Riyadh, the Saudi capital.
        
        Still, Devon and other terror experts believe Al Qaeda will quickly find a replacement.
        
        "The fact that he was killed is a big blow to Al Qaeda, but someone else will come along and take his place. This is definitely not the end of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula," Devon said.
        
        Al-Muqrin, believed to be in his early 30s, was behind the planning for deadly attacks last November at a residential complex in Riyadh where many Western workers lived. Seventeen people were killed and 100 others injured in that attack.
        
        Often pictured wearing a black hood, al-Muqrin spearheaded an Al Qaeda scheme to try to topple the pro-Bush Saudi royal family by attacking Westerners, particularly oil industry workers.
        
        Early in his career as a jihad fighter, Muqrin fought alongside other Islamic militants on behalf of Bosnian Muslims in the Balkans.
        
        Muqrin was also a top goon assigned to a hit squad that tried to knock off Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Ethiopia in 1995. He spent two years in jail in Ethiopia before he was extradited to Saudi Arabia in 1998. kbazinet@edit.nydailynews.com

    textlede: Second American hostage beheaded by the terrorists
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        AL QAEDA terrorists yesterday beheaded an American hostage and displayed his severed head on the Internet.
        
        But shortly after Paul Johnson was butchered in Saudi Arabia, his killers were themselves ambushed and shot dead.
        
        Defence engineer Mr Johnson, 49, was decapitated on the orders of Osama Bin Laden's top lieutenant in Saudi Arabia, Abdulaziz al-Moqrin.
        
        Security forces were just too late to save Mr Johnson's life but as al-Moqrin and his henchmen tried to dispose of his body they were surrounded by Saudi marksmen.
        
        Al-Moqrin and two other fanatics died in the shootout. Another was wounded and captured while two more escaped.
        
        Al-Moqrin, who trained with Bin Laden in Afghanistan, was believed to be the leader of the group calling itself Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which claimed responsibility for yesterday's beheading.
        
        Mr Johnson's barbaric death was the second beheading of an American captive by Islamic fanatics in only five weeks. It comes amid a dramatic rise in violence against Westerners in Saudi Arabia.
        
        His captors said they had killed him after a deadline ran out for the Saudi government to release jailed militants.
        
        President Bush said the murder showed 'the evil nature of the enemy we face'.
        
        'These are barbaric people,' said Mr Bush. 'There's no justification whatsoever for his murder. And yet they killed him in cold blood.
        
        'They're trying to intimidate America. They're trying to get us to retreat from the world. America will not be intimidated. May God bless Paul Johnson.'
        
        Tony Blair, speaking in Brussels at the close of an EU summit said he was 'shocked at such an act of barbarism'.
        
        The grisly pictures of what was said to be Mr Johnson, along with a chilling message from his killers, were shown on the militant Al Islah website.
        
        'As we promised, we have beheaded the American Paul Johnson after the deadline given to the tyrannical Saudi government passed,' said the statement from Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.
        
        The site showed three pictures of what appeared to be Mr Johnson's head. In one it was propped up on the back of a body in an orange uniform with a knife on the face.
        
        A second picture showed a hand lifting up the head, and a third showed the body and head from a different angle.
        
        The Al Qaeda statement continued: 'The infidel got his fair treatment. Let him taste something from what Muslims tasted who were long reached by Apache helicopter fire and missiles.' Mr Johnson worked on Apache helicopters, which have been extensively used by U.S. forces in the Middle East. His death comes five weeks after U.S. contractor, Nick Berg, was beheaded in Iraq. His actual death was shown on the Internet.
        
        Mr Johnson died 72 hours after he was paraded on an Islamic website alongside the terrorists' demands. His Thai wife, Thanom, had made a television appeal for his life.
        
        'When I see pictures of my husband, I hurt so much, I fall to the floor,' she said in broken English. 'He hasn't done anything wrong.' The FBI and Saudi security forces had been searching mountain caves and farms for Mr Johnson yesterday and more than 15,000 Saudi officers were making door-todoor searches in Riyadh.
        
        Al Qaeda wants to topple the pro-U.S. monarchy and drive Westerners out of the world's largest oil exporter.
        
        The government there has arrested or killed scores of militants but has failed to reassure the thousands of Westerners there on how it will stop further attacks.
        
        The killing will add to fears that Bin Laden may be planning more executions in the run-up to the handover of power in Iraq to an interim government on June 30.
        
        The death of Al-Moqrin, 31, however, is a major success against the terrorists, especially as the bomb expert was seen as one of Bin Laden's inner circle.
        
        The kidnap and death of Mr Johnson follows a spate of attacks of Westerners.
        
        On June 12, the day he was captured, Kenneth Scroggs, another U.S. defence worker was shot in the back three times in Riyadh and killed.
        
        On June 6 gunmen killed Simon Cumbers, an Irish cameraman working for the BBC, and seriously wounded his British colleague Frank Gardner in Riyadh.
        
        On May 30, Saudi commandos freed 41 hostages captured by militants in a housing compound.
        
        Twentytwo civilians were killed, including an American, a Briton and an Italian.
        
        END

    textlede: Saudis kill al-Qaeda leader after group beheads American
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Security officials in Riyadh killed the presumed leader of al-Qaeda's Saudi Arabia branch in a shootout last night, hours after the terrorist group took credit for beheading an American defence contractor.
        
        Abdulaziz Issa Abdul-Mohsin al-Moqrin was shot during a gun battle with militants in a central neighbourhood in the Saudi capital, security officials told foreign journalists. Two other militant fighters were reported killed in the siege, which came after a dramatic day that escalated the unrest taking hold of the world's largest oil exporter and roused the ire of U.S. President George W. Bush.
        
        Mr. al-Moqrin's group, calling itself al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, claimed responsibility for the slaying of Paul Johnson Jr., a Lockheed Martin defence contractor who was kidnapped last weekend. The group posted three gruesome photographs on a website - one of which showed a severed head, presumably that of Mr. Johnson, placed on the back of a body wearing an orange jump suit. Another picture showed the head in a pool of blood.
        
        Mr. Johnson, who worked on Apache helicopter systems, was seized from his home in the Saudi capital last weekend, the same day that another U.S. employee of Lockheed Martin was shot dead in his garage in the city. A third American in the kingdom was killed days earlier.
        
        Mr. Bush vowed to pursue the "barbaric people" responsible for the slaying.
        
        "They are trying to intimidate America. They are trying to shake our will," Mr. Bush said during a campaign stop in Seattle.
        
        "They're trying to get us to retreat from the world," he added, but "America will not be intimidated by these kinds of extremist terrorist thugs."
        
        In its Internet message, Mr. al-Moqrin's group said it had meted out its own form of justice after the Saudi government refused to adhere to yesterday's deadline for releasing 700 al-Qaeda prisoners.
        
        "The infidel got his fair treatment," the statement said.
        
        "Let him taste something of what Muslims have long tasted from Apache helicopter fire and missiles."
        
        Mr. al-Moqrin, a native of Riyadh, rose to prominence last November when a group linked to him carried out a suicide bombing at a residential compound for foreign workers in the Saudi capital, killing 17 and injuring 122. He also claimed responsibility for last month's attack in the Persian Gulf city of Khobar, killing 22 people at another complex housing Westerners.
        
        After leaving Saudi Arabia at 17, Mr. al-Moqrin trained at terrorist camps in Afghanistan before travelling to Bosnia, Algeria and Somalia, where he fought alongside other militants. He later returned to Saudi Arabia.
        
        At a news conference in Washington, Saudi diplomat Adel al-Jubeir denounced those responsible for Mr. Johnson's death.
        
        "This is an attack against humanity, this is an attack against decency, this is an attack against the innocent, this is an attack against the universal values we all share as human beings," he said.
        
        Asked to comment on a U.S. State Department advisory calling for Americans to leave Saudi Arabia, Mr. al-Jubeir said that one of al-Qaeda's goals is to drive foreigners out of the kingdom - an evacuation could play into the terrorists' hands.
        
        The Saudi government had refused to negotiate with the terrorists and assigned thousands of police and security forces to search the Saudi capital for the captive American.
        
        "We did everything we could to find him," Mr. al-Jubeir said, "and we are deeply sorry that it was not enough."
        
        James Oberwetter, the U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia, praised the Saudi efforts to find Mr. Johnson, whose body was found in a remote area north of Riyadh.
        
        Mr. Johnson's family remained in seclusion in the New Jersey town of Little Egg Harbor as news of his beheading spread.
        
        "It's just horrible for them," neighbour Stephanie Mahr told Reuters News Agency.
        
        "I just can't imagine what they are going through."
        
        Mr. Johnson had lived and worked in Saudi Arabia for the past 10 years. The killing was uncomfortably similar to last month's beheading of Nicholas Berg, a young businessman from Philadelphia who was killed in Iraq.
        
        Saudi Arabia's security situation has deteriorated rapidly since May of 2003, when suicide bombers targeted three compounds housing foreigners. Since then, there have been other suicide attacks, targeted killings of foreigners and periodic gun battles between security forces and presumed terrorists.
        
        Ali Al-Ahmed, director of the Washington-based Saudi Institute and a critic of the House of Saud, which has ruled the kingdom since its founding, said that the beheading of Mr. Johnson is another indication that Saudi Arabia needs the help of the international community.
        
        "There are sympathizers of al-Qaeda in the government," Mr. Al-Ahmed said, "so you cannot trust sympathizers to go after their friends and cousins."

    textlede: Saudi al-Qaida leader had early extremist roots
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- The man considered the leader of al-Qaida in Saudi Arabia, who was killed in a clash with security forces in Riyadh on Friday, took up the Muslim extremist war when he was a teenager and battled around the world.
        
        Abdulaziz Issa Abdul-Mohsin al-Moqrin, 31, was believed to be the leader of the group calling itself al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula that claimed responsibility for beheading American hostage Paul M. Johnson Jr. Johnson's death was reported Friday.
        
        Al-Moqrin's fighters are blamed for a recent string of terror strikes in Saudi Arabia, among them the May 29 shooting and hostage-taking attack on the oil hub of Khobar that killed 22 people, most of them foreigners, and the Nov. 8, 2003, suicide bombing at Riyadh housing compounds that killed 17, mostly non-Saudi Muslims working in the kingdom.
        
        Al-Moqrin was born in Shagra, a village 100 miles northeast of the capital, Riyadh. Saudi newspapers have reported he later lived in Sweidi, a district in Riyadh known as a hotbed of Islamic extremism.
        
        A BBC cameraman was shot and a correspondent wounded while reporting in Sweidi earlier this month.
        
        Evan Kohlman, an expert who maintains an Internet database on terrorism, said al-Moqrin was a "dropout from the Saudi educational system" who fought with other Saudis against the Soviets in Afghanistan in the late 1980s.
        
        Saudi security officials say al-Moqrin trained with Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan and later fought in Bosnia and Algeria.
        
        Saudi security officials say al-Moqrin was arrested in 1999 for illegally crossing the border into Yemen and was sent home, where he spent two years in prison.
        
        Saudi security officials say al-Moqrin took over al-Qaida operations in the kingdom after his predecessor was killed by security agents earlier this year, but he had masterminded attacks before that.
        
        Al-Moqrin's predecessor, Khaled Ali Haj, a Yemeni, had succeeded Youssef al-Airi, who was killed in a clash with Saudi security forces in early 2003.
        
        Al-Moqrin, known as a smart and brutal tactician, was the most-wanted militant in Saudi Arabia. His attacks in recent months have shown tactical flexibility -- devastating car bombs as well as pinpointed strikes like the kidnapping of Johnson, a first.
        
        The militants also have committed acts apparently meant to sow fear -- such as tying the bodies of their victims to cars and dragging them through the streets -- and have used the Internet to spread that fear.
        
        An Internet statement last month purportedly from al-Moqrin said al-Qaida relies on independent cells that function without "organizational cohesion."
        
        The statement said al-Qaida cells follow the group's example as well as books and periodicals on how to carry out attacks.
        
        In another Internet statement attributed to Al-Moqrin, he indicated he was recruiting Saudis to fight the U.S.-led occupation army in neighboring Iraq.
        
        "By sending our fighters to Iraq, we are not only serving the Iraqi cause, but the cause of Islam," the statement said.
        
        A video that surfaced on Web sites in April showed a masked man identified as al-Moqrin vowing to avenge the slaying of Muslims in Iraq and Afghanistan by expelling Americans from the Arabian Peninsula.

    textlede: Beheading triggers reprisal; American slain; Saudis hunt, kill al-Qaida leader, 4 militants
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- An al-Qaida cell beheaded American engineer Paul M. Johnson Jr., and in a swift retaliation, officials said Saudi security forces tracked down and killed the leader of the terrorist group in a shootout Friday.
        
        Johnson, who was kidnapped last weekend, was the latest victim of an escalating campaign of violence against Westerners that aims to drive foreign workers from the kingdom and undermine the ruling royal family, hated by al-Qaida.
        
        The death hours later of Abdulaziz al-Moqrin, the reputed leader of al-Qaida in the kingdom, was a coup for the Saudi government, which has been under intense pressure to halt a wave of attacks against Westerners. In a video posted on the Internet on Tuesday, a hooded al-Moqrin held an assault rifle and shouted demands for the release of al-Qaida prisoners as a blindfolded Johnson sat in a chair.
        
        Saudi forces killed four other al-Qaida militants in Friday's shootout, which came after a witness reported the license plate number of a car from which the militants dumped Johnson's body and police then stopped the vehicle at a gas station, security officials said.
        
        But they were too late to save Johnson, whose severed head was shown on a Web site Friday. The photographs and a statement, in the name of Fallujah Brigade of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, appeared after Johnson's wife went on Arab television and tearfully pleaded for his release.
        
        "In answer to what we promised ... to kill the hostage Paul Marshall [Johnson] after the period is over ... the infidel got his fair treatment," the al-Qaida statement said.
        
        "Let him taste something of what Muslims have long tasted from Apache helicopter fire and missiles," the statement said.
        
        Johnson, 49, worked on Apache attack helicopter systems for Lockheed Martin. His captors had threatened to kill him by Friday if the kingdom did not release its al-Qaida prisoners. The Saudi government rejected the demands.
        
        President Bush said the execution "shows the evil nature of the enemy we face."
        
        "They're trying to get us to retreat from the world," Bush said.
        
        "America will not retreat. America will not be intimidated by these kinds of extremist thugs. May God bless Paul Johnson."
        
        Johnson's family in Galloway Township, N.J., said authorities worked as hard as they could to rescue him, and that his slaying did not dampen their respect for his adopted country.
        
        "Paul considered Saudi Arabia his home. He loved the people and the country," said an FBI agent speaking on behalf of Johnson's relatives.
        
        "They also know this act of terrorism was committed by extremists and does not represent the Saudi Arabia that Paul often spoke and wrote about to his family," said Joseph Billy Jr., special agent in charge of the FBI's Newark office.
        
        John Hayes, a childhood friend of Johnson's, was overcome with emotion.
        
        "It's just unbelievable. He didn't deserve that," said Hayes, 50.
        
        "This man wasn't even fighting a war over there."
        
        Shortly after discovering Johnson's body 20 miles north of the capital, Saudi police swooped down on the al-Malz neighborhood in central Riyadh and exchanged fire with al-Qaida suspects.
        
        Saudi officials in Washington said on condition of anonymity that five Saudi security officers were killed in the gunbattle. Two suspects escaped, said one Saudi security official who took part in the raid.
        
        A senior Saudi official in Washington identified the other dead militants as:
        
        *Turki al-Sahaid, said to have been involved in the May 29 shooting and hostage-taking attack on the oil hub of Khobar that killed 22 people, most of them foreigners.
        
        *Faisal Abdulrahman Abdullah al-Dakheel, who was on the government's list of 26 most-wanted militants.
        
        *Rakan al-Sakhain, the second most-wanted man and an alleged associate of the mastermind of the bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen's port of Aden in October 2000.
        
        *Ibrahim al-Drhaim, who was not identified further.
        
        One of the three photographs posted Friday on the Web site showed a man's head, face toward the camera, being held by a hand. The two others showed a beheaded body lying prone on a bed, with the severed head placed in the small of his back, the clothes underneath bloodied. One showed a bloody knife resting on the face.
        
        The beheaded body was dressed in a bright orange jumpsuit, similar to one Johnson is seen wearing in earlier videos released by the kidnappers.
        
        "To the Americans and whoever is their ally in the infidel and criminal world and their allies in the war against Islam, this action is punishment to them and a lesson for them to know that whoever steps foot in our country, this decisive action will be his fate," the al-Qaida statement said.
        
        There are 35,000 Americans among the millions of Westerners who work in Saudi Arabia.
        
        Soon after the statement appeared, the Web site was inaccessible, with a message saying it was closed for maintenance.
        
        Johnson is the second American to be kidnapped and beheaded in the Middle East in just over a month.
        
        American businessman Nicholas Berg was beheaded by his captors in Iraq, and his last moments later appeared on a videotape posted on an al-Qaida-linked Web site. His body was found May 12. U.S. officials say al-Qaida-linked Muslim militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi may have been Berg's killer.
        
        Johnson's beheading is the latest in a new, more dramatic wave of terror attacks for Saudi Arabia: bodies dragged on streets, traffic police blown up in their offices, hotel guests taken hostage and a chef shot outside an ATM machine. The attacks have killed dozens of people, mostly foreigners, over the past two months.
        
        Johnson was seized on June 12, the same day that Islamic militants shot and killed Kenneth Scroggs of Laconia, N.H., in his garage in Riyadh.
        
        Scroggs worked for Advanced Electronics Co., a Saudi firm whose Web site lists Lockheed Martin among its customers. The office number on Johnson's business card was for Advanced Electronics.
        
        The same week as Scroggs' death, militants shot and killed another American, Robert Jacobs, and an Irish citizen in Riyadh.
        
        Earlier, Saudi security forces launched an all-out search, going door-to-door in some Riyadh neighborhoods, and Johnson's Thai wife, Thanom, made an appearance on Al-Arabiya.
        
        "When I see his picture in TV, I fall down," Thanom said, fighting back tears.
        
        "When I hear the name Paul Johnson, I cry a lot."
        
        But residents of three Islamic fundamentalist districts in Riyadh, interviewed before news broke of Johnson's killing, suggested that the kidnappers enjoyed popular support, partly because of U.S. policy in Iraq and its perceived backing for Israel.
        
        "How can we inform on our brothers when we see all these pictures coming from Abu Ghraib and Rafah," Muklas Nawaf told The Associated Press as he ate meat grilled on a spit at a restaurant called Jihad, or holy war in Arabic.
        
        He was referring to the pictures of Iraqis abused by U.S. soldiers at the Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad and Israeli military incursions and killings in the Gaza refugee camp of Rafah.
        
        "This is not a little skirmish. It is a war," Nawaf said.

    textlede: US hostage beheaded by al Qaeda;Militants' leader killed dumping body
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        AL QAEDA terrorists last night beheaded an American hostage in Saudi Arabia, and were later killed in a gun battle with security forces.
        
        The body of Paul Johnson, 49, an engineer who worked on Apache helicopters, was found in a rural area, 25 miles north-east of the capital, Riyadh.
        
        Saudi troops then surrounded a group of militants, and killed three of them, including the leader of al Qaeda in Saudi Arabia, Abdulaziz al Muqrin, 31, a veteran of the Bosnian conflict. Police said the militants had been seen dumping the body from a car. It was stopped, and the shootout began.
        
        Al Muqrin's group has claimed to be behind recent attacks in the oil kingdom, such as the atrocity in al Khobar where 22 were killed, including Michael Hamilton, from Kilmarnock.
        
        The two other militants killed were also on Saudi Arabia's most wanted list. Another man, who was injured and arrested, was named as Rakan al Saykhan, said to be second on the most wanted list behind al Muqrin.
        
        There was international condemnation for Mr Johnston's murder. George W Bush said: "The murder of Paul shows the evil nature of the enemy we face. These are barbaric people."
        
        The US president added: "They're trying to intimidate America \.\.\. America will not be intimidated by these kinds of extremist thugs."
        
        Tony Blair, in Brussels, spoke of his "shock at such an act of barbarism". He expressed his sympathy for Mr Johnson's family and added: "This shows the nature of the people we are fighting day in, day out, around the world."
        
        Turki al Faisal, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to Britain, said: "This is an evil act by evil people. We will continue to use every effort to fight this murderous cult in Saudi Arabia."
        
        Mr Johnson's Thai wife, Thanom, had appealed for his release on the Saudi-owned satellite TV channel al Arabiya.
        
        "When I see his picture in TV, I fall down. When I hear the name Paul Johnson, I cry a lot," she said, fighting back tears.
        
        A statement signed by the Fallujah Brigade of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the name it uses for Saudi Arabia, said it had beheaded Mr Johnson "after the deadline that the mujahideen gave to the tyrannical Saudi government pas-sed". It had demanded the release of jailed militants.
        
        Its website showed three pictures of what appeared to be Mr Johnson's severed head. One showed the bloodied head propped up on the back of a body in an orange jumpsuit with a knife leaning on the face. A second showed a hand lifting up the head and a third image revealed the body and the severed head from a different angle.
        
        Mr Johnson had been held hostage since last week. The statement said he had been killed because of "what Muslims have suffered from American Apache planes and their rockets \.\.\. The slain American parasite was working on their maintenance and developing their systems in Saudi Arabia".
        
        The statement told other Americans they would meet a similar fate in Saudi Arabia. Later the US embassy also warned of the "probability" of more attacks against Americans.
        
        The beheaded body was clad in a bright orange suit, similar to those issued to suspects imprisoned by the US at Guantanamo Bay.
        
        It was also similar to the suit that another American captive, Nicholas Berg, was wearing when he was beheaded in Iraq last month.

        RIYADH, Saudi Arabia - An al-Qaida cell beheaded American engineer Paul M. Johnson Jr., and in a swift retaliation, officials said Saudi security forces tracked down and killed the leader of the terrorist group in a shootout yesterday.
        
        Johnson, who was kidnapped last weekend, was the latest victim of an escalating campaign of violence against Westerners that aims to drive foreign workers from the country and undermine the ruling royal family, hated by al-Qaida.
        
        The death hours later of Abdulaziz al-Moqrin, the reputed leader of al-Qaida in the kingdom, was a coup for the Saudi government, which has been under intense pressure to halt the wave of attacks. In a video posted on the Internet Tuesday, a hooded al-Moqrin held an assault rifle and shouted demands for the release of al-Qaida prisoners as Johnson sat blindfolded.
        
        Saudi forces killed four other al-Qaida militants in yesterday's shootout, which came after a witness reported the license plate number of a car from which the militants dumped Johnson's body and police then stopped the vehicle at a gas station, security officials said.
        
        But they were too late to save Johnson, whose severed head was shown on a Web site yesterday. The photographs and a statement, in the name of Fallujah Brigade of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, appeared after Johnson's wife went on Arab television and tearfully pleaded for his release.
        
        "In answer to what we promised ... to kill the hostage Paul Marshall [Johnson] after the period is over ... the infidel got his fair treatment," the al-Qaida statement said.
        
        "Let him taste something of what Muslims have long tasted from Apache helicopter fire and missiles," the statement said.
        
        Johnson, 49, worked on Apache attack helicopter systems for Lockheed Martin. His captors had threatened to kill him by yesterday if the kingdom did not release its al-Qaida prisoners. The Saudi government rejected the demands.
        
        President Bush said the execution "shows the evil nature of the enemy we face."
        
        "They're trying to get us to retreat from the world," Bush said.
        
        "America will not retreat. America will not be intimidated by these kinds of extremist thugs. May God bless Paul Johnson."
        
        Johnson's family in Galloway Township, N.J., said authorities worked as hard as they could to rescue him, and that his slaying did not dampen their respect for his adopted country.
        
        "Paul considered Saudi Arabia his home. He loved the people and the country," said an FBI agent speaking on behalf of Johnson's relatives.
        
        "They also know this act of terrorism was committed by extremists and does not represent the Saudi Arabia that Paul often spoke and wrote about to his family," said Joseph Billy Jr., special agent in charge of the FBI's Newark office.
        
        John Hayes, a childhood friend of Johnson's, was overcome with emotion.
        
        "It's just unbelievable. He didn't deserve that," said Hayes, 50.
        
        "This man wasn't even fighting a war over there."
        
        Shortly after discovering Johnson's body 20 miles north of the capital, Saudi police swooped down on the al-Malz neighborhood in central Riyadh and exchanged fire with al-Qaida suspects.
        
        Saudi officials in Washington said on condition of anonymity that five Saudi security officers were killed in the gunbattle. Two suspects escaped, said one Saudi security official who took part in the raid.
        
        A U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed that al-Moqrin, 31, was one of the dead. A Saudi official said forensic tests would be conducted on the body to confirm his identity.
        
        Saudi security officials say al-Moqrin trained with Saudi exile Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan and later fought in Bosnia and Algeria. Known as a smart and brutal tactician, al-Moqrin became the most-wanted militant in Saudi Arabia. A senior Saudi official in Washington identified the other militants killed yesterday as:
        
        - Turki al-Sahaid, said to have been involved in the May 29 shooting and hostage-taking attack on the oil hub of Khobar that killed 22 people, most of them foreigners.
        
        - Faisal Abdulrahman Abdullah al-Dakheel, on the government's list of 26 most-wanted militants.
        
        - Rakan al-Sakhain, the second most-wanted man and an alleged associate of the mastermind of the bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen's port of Aden in October 2000.
        
        - Ibrahim al-Drhaim.
        
        One of the three photographs posted yesterday on the Web site showed a man's head, face toward the camera, being held by a hand. The two others showed a beheaded body lying prone on a bed, with the severed head placed in the small of his back, the clothes underneath bloodied. One showed a bloody knife resting on the face.
        
        The beheaded body was dressed in a bright orange jumpsuit, similar to one Johnson is seen wearing in earlier videos released by the kidnappers.
        
        "To the Americans and whoever is their ally in the infidel and criminal world and their allies in the war against Islam, this action is punishment to them and a lesson for them to know that whoever steps foot in our country, this decisive action will be his fate," the al-Qaida statement said.
        
        There are 35,000 Americans among the millions of Westerners who work in Saudi Arabia.
        
        Soon after the statement appeared, the Web site was inaccessible, with a message saying it was closed for maintenance.

    textlede: Slain al-Qaida leader linked to violent episodes
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        RIYADH, Saudi Arabia - The man considered the leader of al-Qaida in Saudi Arabia, who was killed in a clash with security forces in Riyadh yesterday, took up the Muslim extremist war when he was a teenager and battled around the world.
        
        Abdulaziz Issa Abdul-Mohsin al-Moqrin, 31, was believed to be the leader of the group calling itself al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula that claimed responsibility for beheading American hostage Paul M. Johnson Jr. Johnson's death was reported yesterday.
        
        Al-Moqrin's fighters are blamed for a recent string of terror strikes in Saudi Arabia, among them the May 29 shooting and hostage-taking attack on the oil hub of Khobar that killed 22 people, most of them foreigners, and the Nov. 8, 2003, suicide bombing at Riyadh housing compounds that killed 17, mostly non-Saudi Muslims working in the kingdom.
        
        Al-Moqrin was born in Shagra, a village 100 miles northeast of the capital, Riyadh. Saudi newspapers have reported he later lived in Sweidi, a district in Riyadh known as a hotbed of Islamic extremism.
        
        A BBC cameraman was shot and a correspondent wounded while reporting in Sweidi earlier this month.
        
        Evan Kohlman, an expert who maintains an Internet database on terrorism, said al-Moqrin was a "dropout from the Saudi educational system" who fought with other Saudis against the Soviets in Afghanistan in the late 1980s.
        
        Saudi security officials say al-Moqrin trained with Osama bin Laden in Af-ghanistan and later fought in Bosnia and Algeria.
        
        Saudi security officials say al-Moqrin was arrested in 1999 for illegally crossing the border into Yemen and was sent home, where he spent two years in prison.
        
        Saudi security officials say al-Moqrin took over al-Qaida operations in the kingdom after his predecessor was killed by security agents earlier this year, but he had masterminded attacks before that.
        
        Al-Moqrin's predecessor, Khaled Ali Haj, a Yemeni, had succeeded Youssef al-Airi, who was killed in a clash with Saudi security forces in early 2003.
        
        Al-Moqrin, known as a smart and brutal tactician, was the most-wanted militant in Saudi Arabia. His attacks in recent months have shown tactical flexibility - devastating car bombs as well as pinpointed strikes such as the kidnapping of Johnson.
        
        The militants also have committed acts apparently meant to sow fear - such as tying the bodies of their victims to cars and dragging them through the streets - and have used the Internet to spread that fear.
        
        An Internet statement last month purportedly from al-Moqrin said al-Qaida relies on independent cells that function without "organizational cohesion."

    textlede: Terrorist Who Left a Trail of Bloodshed Is Reportedly Killed
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        In the months that he served as the leader of Al Qaeda's operations in Saudi Arabia, Abdelaziz Issa Abdul-Mohsen al-Muqrin cut a swath of alarming bloodshed.
        
        The most wanted of Saudi Arabia's hunted terrorists, his violent spree end abruptly on Friday when he was reportedly gunned down along with two of the kingdom's other most wanted in a firefight at a gas station in downtown Riyadh.
        
        His died just hours after the group he led, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, splashed gruesome pictures of the beheading of its latest victim, Paul M. Johnson Jr., a 49-year-old American engineer, across the Internet.
        
        A recent profile of Mr. Muqrin in the London-based newspaper Sharq Al Awsat said the extremist, who was in his early 30's and was known by the code name Abu Hajar, followed a fairly standard path of fighters seeking to spend their life in jihad.
        
        Raised in the Riyadh neighborhood of Suweidi, home to many of the country's current crop of religious radicals, he apparently quit high school at age 17 to fight in Afghanistan.
        
        He married at age 19 and had a daughter, now 10, from that marriage, but his wife sued for divorce on the grounds of desertion.
        
        His fighting skills were such that he was promoted to chief trainer in the Afghanistan camp where he enrolled, spending much of 1990 to 1994 there. His next stop was Algeria, where he fought with the Islamic Front in the brutal civil war and was assigned to smuggling weapons from Spain via Morocco.
        
        From there he moved to the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and then to Somalia and Ethiopia, where he was ultimately detained and extradited to Saudi Arabia.
        
        Sentenced to four years in jail, Mr. Muqrin proved an exemplary inmate, spending his time memorizing the entire Koran. He was freed after just two years. He was reportedly subjected to fierce torture, however, which further enraged him against the government, and he returned to Afghanistan for more training.
        
        "Somewhere along the line he might have been directly working with Osama bin Laden," one Western analyst said. Yet Mr. Muqrin's group, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, is viewed as more of a franchise operation than a subsidiary of Mr. bin Laden's operations. While the group was inspired by the Qaeda goal of toppling the Saudi royal family and fighting the West, analysts said it was not acting under Mr. bin Laden's direct orders.
        
        Mr. Muqrin had a fairly low profile until he took over the group in March after his two immediate predecessors died in firefights with the security police. Although initially concentrating on car bombings, he was stung by criticism that he was killing Muslims and stymied by the fact that security forces captured numerous booby-trapped vehicles.
        
        He also seemed to be having trouble recruiting, putting a how-to manual of urban warfare on the Internet and suggesting that anyone who hated the government use it to carry out attacks.
        
        But on May 1, another Qaeda-inspired group acting in the port of Yanbu killed six foreigners and one Saudi by making a direct assault on a foreign petrochemical project office. That is believed to have inspired Mr. Muqrin to carry out the attack in Khobar and a string of killings in Riyadh.
        
        He seemed to take delight in publicity, especially in showing the gory details of his operations in videotapes, in which he appeared in a black ski mask.
        
        In his absence, the group's future strength is in question. While Saudi Arabia does not lack Qaeda sympathizers, the number of organizers and active fighters is unknown. Analysts believe there are no figures left with the same kind of experience.
        
        "The threat from them is not infinite, but it is not clear how big it really is," the Western analyst said.

    textlede: ACTING ON THREAT, SAUDI GROUP KILLS CAPTIVE AMERICAN
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        A Saudi militant group said Friday that it had carried out its threat to execute a kidnapped American engineer, posting three grisly pictures of his beheaded corpse on a Web site before leaving the body in a remote neighborhood of the capital, Riyadh.
        
        Within hours, Abdelaziz al-Muqrin, the leader of the group -- an offshoot of Al Qaeda that claimed responsibility for the kidnapping and a string of recent attacks on expatriates -- was killed in a firefight with Saudi security forces in downtown Riyadh, local press reports said.
        
        The gruesome slaying of the engineer, Paul M. Johnson Jr., 49, underscored the steady ratcheting up of bloodshed in the kingdom over the past two months and sent shock waves through its large expatriate community.
        
        In Washington, the killing brought swift criticism from President Bush, who called it a "barbaric" act.
        
        "The murder of Paul shows the evil nature of the enemy we face," President Bush said.
        
        "There's no justification whatsoever for his murder, and yet they killed him in cold blood. And it should remind us that we must pursue these people, and bring them to justice before they hurt other Americans."
        
        There was no immediate reaction from the Saudi ruling family, but at the embassy in Washington, Adel al-Jubeir, speaking for the government, said, "The people of Saudi Arabia are outraged by the cruel and cold-blooded murder of this innocent man."
        
        [Saudi Arabia's security forces arrested 10 supporters of Mr. Muqrin's, Al Arabiya television reported on Saturday, according to Reuters. Al Arabiya, quoting security sources, said the arrests took place on Friday night in Riyadh. It said the 10 people seized were believed to be part of the same cell as Mr. Muqrin.]
        
        The statement accompanying the beheading pictures said that Mr. Johnson's killing was revenge for all the Muslims killed by Americans and their weapons in Palestine, Afghanistan and various other conflicts around the world. Mr. Johnson, an employee of Lockheed Martin, specialized in working on the targeting and night vision systems of Apache helicopters in more than a decade spent in the kingdom.
        
        "He tasted what thousands of Muslims taste every day because of the fire from the American Apache, its rockets and its flames that tortured Muslims," the statement from Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula said.
        
        The Saudi government did not immediately confirm that its security forces had killed the militant leader, Mr. Muqrin, and two others. But reports on the Arab satellite channel Al Arabiya and other local press reports said that the police, apparently acting on a tip that reportedly came from the house where Mr. Johnson's body was found, followed three cars bearing the militants and eventually opened fire on them at a gas station.
        
        [The Associated Press, quoting Saudi officials in Washington, reported that five Saudi security officers were killed in the gunbattle. Four militants in addition to Mr. Muqrin were also killed, it said: Turki al-Sahaid, Faisal Abdulrahman Abdullah al-Dakheel, Rakan al-Sakhain and Ibrahim al-Drhaim.]
        
        Mr. Muqrin's death would remove the source of much of the recent bloodshed, with no obvious replacement.
        
        "Al-Muqrin is the last well-known leader of Al Qaeda in Saudi Arabia," said Mushairy al-Zaidy, a journalist and specialist in extremist groups, speaking on Al Arabiya. He noted that two other leaders had been killed in the past three months, leaving Mr. Muqrin the most prominent of the 18 wanted terrorists still at large.
        
        "There is no one as important to replace him," he said.
        
        Two of those killed with Mr. Muqrin, the brothers Faisal and Bandar al-Dakheel, were also on the most-wanted list, Al Arabiya said.
        
        The United States Embassy in Riyadh confirmed that the pictures on the Web site showed Mr. Johnson's severed head and that his body had been found later in eastern Riyadh.
        
        The most detailed photograph showed the head on the back of Mr. Johnson's body with a knife leaning against its forehead and blood splashed all over and around the orange jumpsuit he was wearing. Another showed a hand lifting up the head and a third, more grainy shot showed the body from a different angle.
        
        Mr. Johnson was kidnapped while driving home from work last Saturday around the time that another American who worked with him was shot dead in his driveway in what seemed to be a carefully planned attack. In a videotaped threat Tuesday, Mr. Muqrin said Mr. Johnson would be executed by Friday unless all mujahedeen fighters linked to Al Qaeda were released. Roughly 1,000 militants or their sympathizers are believed to be held in Saudi jails.
        
        There was never really any chance of their release, and Saudi analysts saw the kidnapping as both a means of prolonging the attention paid to the militant group, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and a way to draw parallels with the treatment of Arab prisoners in Guantanamo, Abu Ghraib and elsewhere.
        
        On the videotape Mr. Johnson was shown blindfolded and wearing what his death photos revealed to be an orange jumpsuit similar to the prisoner garb at Guantanamo and elsewhere.
        
        The statement that accompanied his death photos said the group was determined to humiliate all "polytheists until we establish a country of Islamic law and justice."
        
        This was a reference to their goal of driving all non-Muslims out of the Arabian peninsula and to undermining the ruling al-Saud dynasty.
        
        The statement threatened all Americans and their allies with a similar fate, saying the killing was a lesson for those in the kingdom.
        
        Mr. Jubeir, the Saudi spokesman, said that 15,000 security personnel were involved in looking for Mr. Johnson, with thousands of locations searched.
        
        "It is a terrible lie that the cowards who committed this inhumane act claim to be Muslim," Mr. Jubeir said.
        
        Lockheed Martin Corporation, the nation's largest military contractor, said in a statement that the death of Mr. Johnson was "a shock to everyone in the Lockheed Martin family."
        
        "Paul was a valued and respected employee who bravely carried out his duties," the company said.
        
        "We grieve along with his family, and we will do everything we can to support them in their hour of need."
        
        After the murder, discussion raged on Islamist Web sites whether such acts fell within accepted behavior in the religion. The country's senior clerics used their pulpits on Friday to condemn the violence, while other imams said it was a Muslim's duty to drive the infidels from the country.
        
        The quick succession of attacks prompted numerous expatriates, especially the highly trained Westerners working in the more technical aspects of oil exploration and development or in finance, to consider leaving the kingdom. For many the first kidnapping and murder of an American could well prove the last straw.
        
        "This has shaken people," said an American who has worked for Aramco for many years, not wanting to be identified further. He noted that while previous attacks against Western residential compounds came every few months, since May 1 there had been an attack on a project office in Yanbu that left six Western engineers dead, a residential compound breached in Khobar with 22 killed, two Americans gunned down in their driveways in Riyadh and two other Westerners killed elsewhere around the capital.
        
        He said there were unconfirmed reports that more than 100 American families alone were planning to leave Aramco, not counting other nationalities.
        
        The United States Embassy in Riyadh said the violence was evidently prompting all Americans to reconsider whether to stay in the kingdom. Diplomats said that June in general marks the start of a long summer exodus of at least two months. While some families were ready to leave for good, others were planning to see how the situation develops over the summer before deciding whether to return.
        
        "I think people are very upset; it's a little bit cumulative," said Carol R. Kalin, the spokeswoman for the American Embassy.
        
        "There are many Americans making plans to leave either temporarily or permanently."
        
        The United States ambassador issued a statement urging the kingdom to focus on the safety of expatriates.
        
        "This has been a rough year for Americans in Saudi Arabia."
        
        said the ambassador, James C. Oberwetter.
        
        "It has been tough on Saudis, too."
        
        Noting the long history of Americans' working to help develop the kingdom, he said, "Those from abroad who are guests of Saudi Arabia must rely on both its leadership and the average citizen for protection, so that good relations can exist between the two nations."

    textlede: MILITANTS BEHEAD AMERICAN IN RETALIATION, SAUDI FORCES KILL AL-QAIDA LEADER IN SHOOTOUT HOURS LATER
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- An al-Qaida cell beheaded American engineer Paul M. Johnson Jr., and in a swift retaliation, officials said Saudi security forces tracked down and killed the leader of the terrorist group in a shootout Friday.
        
        Johnson, who was kidnapped last weekend, was the latest victim of an escalating campaign of violence against Westerners that aims to drive foreign workers from the kingdom and undermine the ruling royal family, hated by al-Qaida.
        
        The death hours later of Abdulaziz al-Moqrin, the reputed leader of al-Qaida in the kingdom, was a coup for the Saudi government, which has been under intense pressure to halt a wave of attacks against Westerners.
        
        In a video posted on the Internet on Tuesday, a hooded al-Moqrin held an assault rifle and demanded the release of al-Qaida prisoners as a blindfolded Johnson sat in a chair.
        
        Saudi forces killed four other al-Qaida militants in Friday's shootout, which came after a witness reported the license plate number of a car from which the militants dumped Johnson's body and police then stopped the vehicle at a gas station, security officials said.
        
        But they were too late to save Johnson, whose severed head was shown on a Web site Friday. The photographs and a statement, in the name of Fallujah Brigade of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, appeared after Johnson's wife went on Arab television and tearfully pleaded for his release.
        
        "In answer to what we promised ... to kill the hostage Paul Marshall (Johnson) after the period is over ... the infidel got his fair treatment," the al-Qaida statement said.
        
        "Let him taste something of what Muslims have long tasted from Apache helicopter fire and missiles," the statement said.
        
        Johnson, 49, worked on Apache attack helicopter systems for Lockheed Martin. His captors had threatened to kill him by Friday if the kingdom did not release its al-Qaida prisoners. The Saudi government rejected the demands.
        
        President Bush said the execution "shows the evil nature of the enemy we face."
        
        "America will not retreat," Bush said.
        
        "We must pursue these people and bring them to justice before they hurt other Americans."
        
        Secretary of State Colin Powell and Vice President Dick Cheney also had pledged to pursue the killers.
        
        "America will hunt these killers, find them one by one and destroy them," Cheney said.
        
        Johnson's family in Galloway Township, N.J., said that authorities worked as hard as they could to rescue him and that his slaying did not dampen their respect for his adopted country.
        
        "Paul considered Saudi Arabia his home. He loved the people and the country," said an FBI agent speaking on behalf of Johnson's relatives.
        
        Shortly after finding Johnson's body 20 miles north of the capital, Saudi police swooped down on a neighborhood in Riyadh and exchanged fire with al-Qaida suspects.
        
        Saudi officials in Washington said on the condition of anonymity that five Saudi security officers were killed in the gunbattle. Two suspects escaped, said a Saudi security official who took part in the raid.
        
        A U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that al-Moqrin, 31, was one of the dead.
        
        Al-Moqrin had led al-Qaida-related terrorists only since March, but was the most-wanted militant in Saudi Arabia. Known as a smart and ruthless leader, he claimed credit for car bombings and terrorist assaults that have taken the lives of dozens of people.
        
        Saudi security officials say al-Moqrin trained with Saudi exile Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan and later fought in Bosnia and Algeria.
        
        "This is a really big deal that he's off the streets," said a U.S. government official who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.
        
        Al-Moqrin's death would remove the source of much of the recent bloodshed, with no obvious replacement.
        
        "Al-Moqrin is the last well-known leader of al-Qaida in Saudi Arabia," said Mushairy Al-Zaidy, a journalist and specialist in extremist groups, speaking on Arab satellite channel al-Arabiya.
        
        He noted that two other leaders had been killed in the past three months, leaving al-Moqrin the most prominent of the 18 wanted terrorists still at large.
        
        "There is no one as important to replace him," he said.
        
        A senior Saudi official in Washington said the other dead militants included one man linked to the May 29 attack in Khobar that killed 22 people, most of them foreigners.
        
        Another was on the government's list of 26 most-wanted militants. A third was the kingdom's second most-wanted man and an alleged associate of the mastermind of the bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen's port of Aden in October 2000.
        
        Johnson is the second American to be kidnapped and beheaded in the Middle East in just over a month.
        
        American businessman Nicholas Berg was beheaded by his captors in Iraq. His body was found May 8. U.S. officials say al-Qaida-linked Muslim militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi may have been Berg's killer.
        
        Johnson's beheading is the latest in a new, more dramatic wave of terror attacks for Saudi Arabia. The attacks have killed dozens of people, mostly foreigners, over the past two months.
        
        Analysts said the beheadings add a new layer of horror to militant attacks, and al-Qaida-linked groups have turned to the tactic to drive away Westerners -- and bring glory to themselves among supporters.
        
        Richard Murphy, a former U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia, said the militants know "what will cause maximum shock in the Western public and particularly the American public."
        
        "It's a political, psychological ploy to show the enemy is merciless, vengeful and will stop at nothing," Murphy said.
        
        There are 35,000 Americans among the millions of Westerners who work in Saudi Arabia, and State Department officials there Friday repeated a 3-month-old warning urging Americans to leave Saudi Arabia.
        
        "There is a good possibility that the attacks will continue," said Carol Kalin, the press attache at the U.S. Embassy in Saudi Arabia.
        
        Other experts agreed.
        
        "Clearly, they've got the Saudis on the defensive," said Larry Johnson, a private terrorism consultant and former CIA and State Department official.
        
        "Westerners are going to continue to be targeted. There will be more beheadings. These guys are going to attempt to drive Westerners out of Saudi Arabia and ultimately destabilize the royal family."
        
        For numerous expatriates, the first kidnapping and murder of an American in the kingdom could well prove the last straw. Many reportedly are considering leaving.
        
        "This has shaken people," said an American who has worked for Aramco for many years, not wanting to be identified further.
        
        He said there are unconfirmed reports that more than 100 American families are planning to leave Aramco alone, not counting other nationalities.
        
        "People are trying to make plans gracefully to exit stage left," he said.

    textlede: The seeds of terrorism sown by Saudi system
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        How do you stop anti-Western terrorism in a place where al-Qaida may have infiltrated the security forces, schools teach a rigid form of Islam and the ruler blames most of his problems on Zionists?
        
        That's the challenge facing Saudi Arabia in the wake of attacks that have killed dozens of foreigners, including Paul Johnson, an American beheaded Friday by an al-Qaida group. And the Saudis' reluctance to acknowledge their own role in the growth of extremism doesn't bode well for the future, experts say.
        
        "Take any cross section of Saudi society and you will find people who do not think slitting the throat of an infidel is a bad thing," says John R. Bradley, a British journalist who worked for a Saudi newspaper.
        
        Another expert predicts violence will continue, even though the Saudis claimed Friday that they killed the leader of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, the group behind the kidnapping and murder of Johnson.
        
        "It seems to me we haven't seen the worst of it yet," says Michael Doran, an assistant professor at Princeton University.
        
        "There are deep-seated problems that are not going to go away."
        
        And as if the Saudis didn't have enough internal trouble, their plodding efforts at reform have been hurt by the chaos in neighboring Iraq.
        
        The United States is "so widely and deeply disliked in Saudi Arabia that it gives democracy a bad name because we're promoting it," says Michael Hudson, professor of Arab studies at Georgetown University.
        
        Ever since oil was discovered in the kingdom in the 1930s, the ruling al Saud family has struggled with two conflicting forces - rapid modernization fueled by oil wealth, and the backward pull of Wahhabism, a puritanical form of Islam whose adherents condemn Western secularism and materialism.
        
        In 1979, Islamic fundamentalists, outraged by what they saw as the corrupting influence of Western culture on the Sauds, seized the Grand Mosque at Mecca. The government crushed the takeover, but it scared the royal family into giving the Wahhabis enormous control over Saudi society and education.
        
        While oil prices were high, Saudis enjoyed a leisurely lifestyle as Americans and other foreigners ran the economy. But when oil prices fell in the mid '80s, the economy soured and Saudis whose education was based on memorizing the Koran had few marketable skills.
        
        As a result, Saudi Arabia finds itself in a paradox - foreigners still hold millions of jobs while unemployment among Saudis is around 30 percent. The difficulty of "Saudi-izing" the workforce - replacing foreigners with natives - was illustrated a few months ago when the travel industry almost collapsed because Saudis couldn't handle even simple jobs like making reservations.
        
        "The work ethic has not really been possible in a place that's been awash in oil," Hudson says.
        
        The high unemployment rate has had a more insidious effect: It makes it easier for extremist groups to recruit dissatisfied young Saudis.
        
        "You have this ideological mixing with these awful economic conditions - there could not be a more opportune situation for a popular uprising," says Bradley, who is writing a book on the kingdom.
        
        "I think al-Qaida is going to ride that wave rather than attack oil installations or the (royal) family."
        
        In recent months, terrorists have gone after "soft" targets with lighter protection. Al-Qaida has claimed responsibility for most of the attacks, including some in which there is evidence of collusion by Saudi security forces.
        
        Last month, former employees of Vinnell, a U.S. company that trains the Saudi National Guard, said some guardsmen knew in advance about the May 2003 bombing of a housing compound in Riyadh that killed 35 people.
        
        As many as 70 guards stayed away that day, leaving the compound defenseless, the employees told London's Independent. Guard members allegedly gave inside help to al-Qaida, possibly including a detailed map of the compound.
        
        And in last month's attack on a compound in Khobar that killed 22, gunmen purportedly wore military uniforms.
        
        "The evidence from the last few weeks is that al-Qaida is in control of the situation, they are deciding when to attack and where to attack while the royal family seems simply to be hoping that the problem will go away," Bradley says.
        
        "They have no strategy to deal with it - the only strategy is the security forces, who have been infiltrated by al-Qaida."
        
        Princeton's Doran says collusion between police and extremists is not surprising, given the government's support of the Wahhabi-brand of education.
        
        "You've got to feel sorry for those poor grunts in the Saudi security system. They're up against a foe that believes deeply in what they're saying and harping on the theme that every Saudi schoolboy has learned from the clerics and is willing to die for. What ideals are the grunts fighting for? They fight for the royal family and who wants to die for the royal family?"
        
        To a great extent, both Saudi Arabia and its longtime ally, the United States, are also paying for their support of Islamic mujahedeen who fought the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, then turned their attention to other "infidels' after the Soviets left in 1989.
        
        Heavy pressure by Islamic fundamentalists on the Saudi regime resulted in the United States pulling most of its troops out of the kingdom. And as violence surged this spring, the State Department urged all Americans - about 35,000 - to get out.
        
        "It's ironic that we have 135,000 troops in Iraq trying to bring democracy to that place while in Saudi Arabia, which arguably is much more important - certainly in oil terms - we are urging people to leave," says Georgetown's Hudson.
        
        Both countries insist their relationship remains strong even though the Bush administration has been frustrated by the Saudis' slowness to acknowledge the real causes of terrorism in the kingdom. Just days after the State Department praised Saudi Arabia for its "aggressive" campaign against terrorists, Crown Prince Abdullah, the de facto ruler, announced that "Zionism is behind everything," Newsweek reported.
        
        A popular "parlor game" in Washington, Hudson notes, is guessing how long the royal family will remain in power. Most experts doubt the country is in imminent danger of revolution but say the Sauds must press ahead with democratic and educational reforms.
        
        For all their drawbacks, the royals often have been a force for modernization and liberalization, using much of the country's oil wealth to build hospitals, highways and schools open to women as well as men.
        
        "But the problem is that whenever they did that in the past, they did it from a position of strength in the middle of the oil boom," Bradley says.
        
        "Now it's the reverse - in the middle of an economic crisis, they have to give up power and marginalize the Wahhabis and there's absolutely no precedent for that."

        IN SAUDI ARABIA
        
        There are about 35,000 Americans, most working in the oil industry.
        
        Lockheed Martin, the Pentagon's biggest contractor and the company for which Paul Johnson worked, manages international aircraft depots in Saudi Arabia but won't disclose the number of employees for security reasons.
        
        Vinnell Corp., a U.S. defense contractor, has about 300 employees in Riyadh who train the Saudi National Guard, charged with protecting oil installations and the royal family.
        
        Saudia Arabia, the world's biggest oil producer, has 26 percent of the world's known reserves.
        
        The population is about 23.5-million, including 5.3-million foreign guest workers.
        
        Before invading Iraq in 2003, the United States had as many as 10,000 troops in Saudi Arabia, but most have been moved to other gulf countries.

    textlede: Saudis Debate Captive's Fate on Web
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        As the deadline loomed for the threatened execution of an American engineer held hostage in Saudi Arabia, with no apparent progress in freeing him, a debate swirled Thursday on Islamist Web sites about whether the killing of foreigners in the kingdom was religiously approved.
        
        Several efforts were made to persuade the militants to spare the life of Paul M. Johnson Jr., 49, by suggesting that Western expatriates working in Saudi Arabia had been invited and were, therefore, protected.
        
        But little optimism was apparent that any such proposal would work. In a videotaped threat issued Tuesday over the Internet, Mr. Johnson's kidnappers said the government had until Friday to release all imprisoned militants or they would kill him.
        
        Saudi security officials announced no results from many searches around the capital, Riyadh, where Mr. Johnson, a specialist in Apache helicopters who worked for Lockheed Martin, was kidnapped Saturday. The searches seemed to be concentrated in Suweidi, a sprawling, impoverished neighborhood.
        
        The area is considered a militant hotbed, hometown to about 15 of the kingdom's 26 most-wanted terrorists, including Abdulaziz al-Muqrin, the self-proclaimed leader of a group called Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which claimed responsibility for the kidnapping and a string of recent violent acts. A cameraman for British Broadcasting Corporation television was shot dead and a correspondent critically wounded early this month while filming in Suweidi.
        
        In one unusual Web site posting, a Saudi man who wrote that he worked with the kidnap victim and had even discussed Islam with him, tried to extend a religiously inspired, traditional tribal form of protection known in Arabic as "ijara" that would forbid killing Mr. Johnson.
        
        "I hereby declare my protection and rescue for this man along with all his colleagues who work with us in the company, who ate with us and accepted our gifts of Islamic books which they promised to read," wrote the man, identified as Saad al-Moemen. He also described visits by Mr. Johnson to his home and said Mr. Johnson had expressed distaste for American foreign policy.
        
        Saudi analysts said such protection was usually issued by respected tribal leaders or religious sheiks and there appear to be few such men whom the militants revere. A few clerics still tried, using open forums on the Internet, the medium of choice for the radicals.
        
        One cleric, identified as Sheik Abu Bassir, reissued a ruling saying that anyone who came to Saudi Arabia with a valid visa should be protected. He wrote that whether foreigners come "to visit, or for tourism, or for trade, or to study, or to tutor, or for therapy, or to get married, or to hear the word of God, they should be safe and should not be terrorized, should not be assaulted."
        
        The exceptions, he wrote, are those who come as warriors or spies or to spread corruption, vice and drugs.
        
        The fatwa, or religious edict, was immediately attacked by a number of readers who said all foreigners, by definition, come to the kingdom with such bad intentions, acting as the vanguard for the American military.
        
        "Whoever gives them security is an apostate," read one posting.
        
        Others scoffed at the idea that an official visa bestowed legitimacy on visitors.
        
        "Who gave them the visa? It is the infidel agent regime," read one posting in part.
        
        "So I tell the mujahedeen to keep killing them until the Arabian peninsula is cleared of the filth of the crusaders."
        
        Still others were not quite so severe, suggesting to the militants that they try to convert Westerners to Islam rather than killing them, because that way they would be spared from going to hell, and the image of the faith around the world would not be so tainted with blood.
        
        Reflecting the differences that are rife in the interpretation of Islam, one religious sheik, identified as Abdel Rahman bin Saleh al-Mahmoud, said that Muhammad's followers had commanded that all nonbelievers be expelled from the Arabian peninsula. But it has never been clear, he wrote, whether that includes just the holy city of Mecca or some larger area. Foreigners visited at the time of the prophet, he noted; it was just the idea of permanent communities that was abhorrent.
        
        One Saudi lawyer prominent in religious affairs said that the religious establishment was preparing to launch a campaign to explain that non-Muslim visitors are permitted. The stated aim of the militants is to undermine the ruling House of Saud by driving from the kingdom millions of expatriates who help keep the economy afloat, especially tens of thousands of Western technicians.
        
        "We want to make clear that anyone who comes to the country to live is different from someone coming to invade," said Muhsin Awaji, the Saudi lawyer. He said he doubted that any such campaign would change the minds of the militants, and would certainly be too late for Mr. Johnson.
        
        "Those very dangerous leaders may not be influenced by anyone from outside," Mr. Awaji said.
        
        "But the others, those sympathetic to them, could be prevented from being recruited for their side."

    textlede: Slim hopes nurtured for hostage; Ribbons, candles and prayers were raised in his hometown.
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Friends and neighbors in his native Ocean County town staged a vigil to pray for the safe return of hostage Paul M. Johnson Jr. yesterday evening, hours after his brother voiced fears for the worst.
        
        Wayne Johnson intermittently broke down in sobs as he spoke of his brother, a 49-year-old defense contractor kidnapped by Islamic militants in Saudi Arabia.
        
        "He's got just one day left," he said from his mobile home in the Manahawkin section of nearby Stafford Township.
        
        "If they kill my brother, I don't know how me or my mother will feel. I'd bring in 1,000 troops to get that one life out."
        
        On Tuesday, a group calling itself al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula said it would kill Johnson in 72 hours if Saudi officials did not release al-Qaeda prisoners. The deadline passes sometime today.
        
        Since then, Johnson's family has been been anxiously waiting. Paul M. Johnson III has made televised appeals for his father's release.
        
        Wayne Johnson said he had not slept for three days.
        
        "I just cry all the time," he said.
        
        "He'd do anything in the world for anybody. Nobody deserves that, not him."
        
        In Little Egg Harbor Township, a man and a woman entering the home of Johnson's sister, Donna Mayeux, had no comment. But around the home near Bass River State Forest, neighbors showed their support.
        
        Johnson grew up a few miles up Route 9 in the West Creek section of mostly rural Eagleswood Township and graduated from Southern Regional High School in Stafford Township. Johnson, an Air Force veteran, moved to Florida in the early 1980s to work for Lockheed Martin. He went to Saudi Arabia for the firm more than a decade ago to service helicopters.
        
        But around these parts, he is still a hometown boy.
        
        Across from Mayeux's home, neighbors yesterday erected a tribute to her brother. Joel Mahr dug three wooden posts into his front lawn. Using wire, he strung 11 yellow ribbons across, flanked by red, white and blue ribbons with stars.
        
        Later, as the soupy humidity gave way to rain, friends and neighbors gathered behind the Eagleswood Fire Company for an evening vigil, held beneath a blue tent adorned with yellow ribbons and a sign that read: "Our creek may be shallow but our roots run deep."
        
        The Rev. James Occhipinti, pastor of Cedar Ridge Assembly of God, told the crowd of about 100 that he was at the World Trade Center shortly after the 9/11 attacks. He saw a sign on a truck there that said: "With every pebble that's moved you are building a mountain of hope for humanity."
        
        Occhipinti likened the crowd, holding candles and waving flags, to those pebbles.
        
        "We may be small in numbers, but we are big in heart," he said.
        
        The 40-minute vigil ended when Johnson's daughter, Tamara, and his niece Angel Roork arrived unexpectedly.
        
        "Your love, your prayers and your support are appreciated," Roork said.
        
        Organizer Dennis C. Seeley Jr., the fire department chaplain, said he had known Johnson casually when both were growing up on Seaman Lane.
        
        "We're a small town," he said.
        
        "Everybody knows everybody."
        
        Seeley said he had organized the event to show the terrorists "that our country would support the family, and we could show other nations that though we may get down, we pull together. I believe in faith."
        
        He said he had faith that Johnson would be found.
        
        "I still believe our God can show our troops where he is," he said.
        
        Sam Sprague, a boyhood friend of Johnson's, was at the vigil. He recalled that when they were young, Johnson was "an electronics genius" who would rig electronic cars to go faster. Sometimes the cars would blow up. Sprague, 48, of Stafford Township, said Johnson once converted a transistor radio into a beeper that sounded every 40 seconds. Johnson then put a magazine over it and put it in the school library to "drive the librarian crazy."
        
        The two would ride motorcycles through local woods, and Sprague recalled how he and friends had ridden their motorcycles to say goodbye to Johnson before he entered the Air Force.
        
        Sprague said he had not seen Johnson since he left for Saudi Arabia. Then he saw his friend's photograph broadcast.
        
        "I didn't recognize him right away because he had put on a lot of weight," Sprague said.
        
        "It turned my stomach upside-down when I realized it was him."

    textlede: Saudi Builds a Reputation As Leader of Terror Cell; Veteran of Afghan Camps Seen Behind Attacks on Westerners
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        The man wears a black hood on the videotape as he grips an AK-47 and threatens to execute an American hostage. In spite of the disguise, a subtitle gives a name for the speaker, Abdulaziz Muqrin, who Saudi authorities say is the chief organizer of the recent attacks on Westerners in Saudi Arabia.
        
        A Saudi native believed to be in his early thirties, Muqrin is a graduate of jihadi training camps in Afghanistan and a veteran of conflicts in Somalia and Bosnia, as well as Algeria, where he was part of a group known for dismembering the bodies of its enemies on videotape, according to Saudi officials and terrorism analysts.
        
        Even so, he was a relatively unknown Islamic radical until last November, when a small cell loyal to him carried out a suicide bombing at a residential compound in Riyadh that housed mostly Westerners, killing 17 people and injuring 122. The attack landed Muqrin on a most-wanted list of 26 terrorist leaders named by the Saudi government.
        
        Since then, Muqrin's name recognition has soared in the Middle East, partly because many of his rivals from other Islamic underground groups have been killed or arrested and partly because he has displayed an unusual knack for using the Internet to gain public attention even while he remains in hiding.
        
        Muqrin's group, known as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, most recently has asserted responsibility for kidnapping Paul M. Johnson Jr., 49, an employee of Bethesda-based Lockheed Martin Corp. Investigators say they also believe the group plotted a series of assassinations and other attacks that have killed more than 40 people since November, most of them Westerners.
        
        In a video released on the Internet this week, a hooded man identified on the screen as Muqrin read a statement saying he would execute Johnson in 72 hours, a period that apparently ends Friday, unless Saudi officials released an unspecified number of radicals who have been captured in recent months.
        
        Johnson was kidnapped last weekend in Riyadh at about the same time another American military contractor, Kenneth Scroggs, was killed by gunmen who had followed him home from work on Saturday. A third American, Robert Jacobs, was killed four days earlier in Riyadh under similar circumstances.
        
        Muqrin has also asserted that he organized an attack on a residential and office compound last month in the Persian Gulf city of Khobar. In that incident, four gunmen broke into the complex in search of Westerners, killed 22 people and held dozens of others hostage. Despite being surrounded by Saudi security forces, three of the four assailants escaped, enabling Muqrin to crow in audio clips and commentaries posted on the Internet that his group had taken on the Saudi government and won.
        
        Khaled Batarfi, managing editor of al-Madina newspaper in Jiddah, said Muqrin has quickly become the public face of al Qaeda in the region, even though it is unclear if he has any direct ties to the group headed by Osama bin Laden.
        
        "He's making a name for himself that is now competing with bin Laden," Batarfi said.
        
        "He's speaking in his name and saying he has the same principles."
        
        According to Saudi officials and Arab media reports, Muqrin dropped out of school at age 17 and left Riyadh to travel to Afghanistan. He spent about four years there, mostly at a jihadi training camp near Khost. He then took his skills to Africa and Europe, working primarily as a weapons smuggler.
        
        He was arrested in Ethiopia in 1998 for belonging to an Islamic rebel group and extradited to Saudi Arabia, where he was sentenced to four years in prison. His conduct in prison was considered so exemplary -- he spent most of his time memorizing the Koran -- that he was released two years early.
        
        In early 2001, Muqrin returned to Afghanistan. He joined the Taliban in fighting U.S. forces there, then returned to Saudi Arabia a year later. It was then, Saudi security officials said, that he began to establish his own local network of radicals.
        
        Saudi officials say they are not sure whether Muqrin is still in the country. Members of his cell who have been arrested have told interrogators that they do not know his whereabouts and have communicated with him only by e-mail or cellular phone. Some Saudi officials say he remains in Riyadh, where he grew up, while others suspect he is hiding along the Yemeni border.
        
        Prince Turki al-Faisal, the former head of Saudi intelligence and now the country's ambassador to Britain, said security forces have eliminated four of five known al Qaeda cells in the country in the past year. He also expressed confidence that Muqrin's group would be rounded up soon as well.
        
        "Only one al Qaeda cell remains operational in Saudi Arabia," Turki said in an interview this month with Jane's Intelligence Review, a London-based publication.
        
        "Even now, it's in the process of being dismantled."
        
        Nawaf Obaid, a security consultant to the Saudi government, said the al Qaeda branch would likely collapse if Muqrin is caught.
        
        "He's been able to keep his group mostly intact, until recently," he said.
        
        "If you catch him, the whole cell gets destroyed. He's the only leader of his caliber left."
        
        Despite an intensive manhunt, however, Muqrin remains at large. And as his profile has grown, so has his rhetoric. In recent weeks, he has issued grandiose statements about his goals: to chase all Westerners out of the Arabian Peninsula, disrupt world oil markets and topple the Saudi royal family.
        
        Some Saudi officials and terrorism analysts said they doubted that he has the ability to stage major terrorist operations, but warned that he would continue to launch small-scale attacks.
        
        "I would describe it as a case of a wounded tiger," said Mohsen Awajy, a Saudi lawyer and former Islamic radical who now advises the Saudi government on dealing with the underground.
        
        "A wounded tiger that knows it's dying but won't go down quietly. He knows he has no choice but to die, so he wants to kill as many people as he can before he does."

    textlede: Saudi Arabia; Militants Hold U.S. Hostage, Set Deadline; Other Developments
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula June 12 took responsibility for the murder that day of U.S. citizen Kenneth Scroggs, who was shot to death by three men outside his home in Riyadh. Scroggs was a business development manager at Advanced Electronics Co., a Saudi defense firm at whose Riyadh headquarters Johnson had also apparently worked. In an earlier attack, U.S. citizen Robert Jacobs June 8 had been shot to death near his home in the capital. Al-Muqrin's group late June 12 posted video footage of that murder on the Internet. Jacobs, 62, worked for Vinnell Corp., a unit of U.S. defense conglomerate Northrop Grumman Corp. Vinnell, which had lost seven employees in the May 2003 attacks, was involved in training and advising the Saudi national guard.
        
        The U.S. embassy June 13 noted that the spate of attacks seemed to have involved extensive planning and surveillance, and warned U.S. citizens to avoid predictable daily routines. Some analysts said that the militants were attempting to increase popular support by focusing on specific foreign targets in the defense and oil sectors, after previous large-scale strikes involving Muslim casualties had sparked public outrage. Al-Muqrin's group June 7 had issued a statement outlining future attacks and warning Muslims to keep their distance from foreigners.
        
        Saudi Arabia's population of about 21 million included some seven million foreigners, most of whom were Asian laborers. The roughly 30,000 Britons and a similar number of U.S. citizens in the country worked mostly in the oil and financial sectors.
        
        Foreigners Slain in Earlier Attacks
        
        British Broadcasting Corp. (BBC) security correspondent Frank Gardner and an Irish freelance cameraman, Simon Cumbers, June 6 were attacked by unidentified gunmen as they recorded footage in the Suweidi district of Riyadh, the home of al-Muqrin and several other leading Saudi terrorist suspects. Cumbers, 36, was killed in the attack, and Gardner was seriously wounded. The British Foreign Office June 13 authorized nonessential embassy staff and family members to leave the country, and British Airways PLC the same day announced that its crews would no longer stay overnight in Saudi Arabia. Long-distance flights would land in neighboring countries, from which shuttle flights would reach Saudi destinations.
        
        Terrorist attacks had killed some 30 foreigners in the country since May 1, when a group of four militants had infiltrated the offices of ABB Lummus, a unit of Swiss-based engineering and oil services firm ABB Ltd., in the Red Sea port city of Yanbu. The gunmen had killed two Britons, two U.S. citizens and an Australian, then dragged the body of one U.S. victim through the streets in a stolen car. Before being confronted and killed by security forces, the militants had stopped at a boys' secondary school, fired into the air and called on the students to join an anti-U.S. insurgency in Fallujah, Iraq. Two Saudi security personnel were killed and dozens of others were wounded in the rampage. In a separate incident in Yanbu that day, an attacker had thrown a pipe bomb into the compound of a school for foreign workers' children. [See 2004 OPEC: Saudis Seek Higher Output as Prices Soar]
        
        ABB Lammus May 2 announced that its non-Saudi workers and their families had decided to leave the country in the wake of the terrorist raid. Saudi authorities May 4 identified the Yanbu gunmen as Mustafa al-Ansari, his brother and two of his nephews. Al-Ansari had entered the country illegally, the officials said, and had links to a British-based Saudi dissident group. However, the group's leader, Saad al-Faqih, maintained that al-Ansari had been out of contact with his organization since the early 1990s. [See below]
        
        Violence later in May had included the May 20 murder of a German chef in a Riyadh shopping area, the deaths of four militants in a May 22 government raid in the northern town of Buraida, and a May 29 hostage-taking in the city of Khobar in which 22 people had died. In that incident, three of the four attackers had been allowed to escape after convincing authorities that the building housing the hostages was rigged with explosives.
        
        Two militants allegedly linked to the Khobar incident June 2 had been killed by security forces at a checkpoint near Mecca, but authorities did not specify whether they had been among the three who escaped. Also June 2, gunmen fired on a pair of U.S. military vehicles near a Saudi national guard base in Riyadh. The U.S. personnel were reportedly part of a unit that was training the Saudi force. Al-Muqrin's group had reportedly claimed both the Khobar raid and the June 2 Riyadh attack.
        
        Islamic Charities Curbed
        
        Saudi foreign policy adviser Adel al-Jubeir, appearing at a news conference with U.S. officials in Washington, D.C., June 2 announced that Saudi Arabia's international Islamic charities would be consolidated under a government-appointed Saudi National Commission for Relief and Charity Work Abroad. The new body, responsible for about $100 million in donations annually, would have monitoring procedures to prevent the diversion of funds to extremist causes. The changes, contained in a February 27 royal decree, would allow the country to resume international charitable financial transfers, which had been frozen since May 2003.
        
        The Saudi and U.S. officials also listed five foreign branches of the Al Haramain Islamic Foundation, a major Saudi charity that had received some $50 million in donations annually, as sources of terrorist financing. The list would be turned over to the United Nations, which upon adopting the designations could authorize the freeze of the branches' assets in all U.N. member states. The five branches were in Afghanistan, Albania, Bangladesh, Ethiopia and the Netherlands. Earlier freezes in March 2002 had shuttered Al Haramain branches in Somalia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina, while a January 2004 move by U.S. and Saudi authorities had targeted branches in Indonesia, Kenya, Tanzania and Pakistan.
        
        The U.S. said it would freeze the assets of Al Haramain's longtime chairman, Aqeel Abdulaziz Aqil, who had recently been dismissed from the post by Saudi religious authorities, and was reportedly under criminal investigation.
        
        Other News
        
        In other Saudi terrorism news:
        
        · The U.S.-based Council on Foreign Relations June 15 issued a report praising the Saudi government for "significant improvements to its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regime," but criticizing it for failing to "demand personal accountability" from wealthy and powerful citizens who continued to finance terrorist activity. The report also blasted Saudi leaders for making unsubstantiated claims that "Zionist" intrigues were behind terrorist attacks in the country. Crown Prince Abdullah had made such statements May 1, as had Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal May 4, in reference to the Yanbu raid. · A group of six Muslim clerics known for criticizing the Saudi regime June 14 issued a statement condemning the recent terrorist attacks, saying, "The bombings and killings have revolted people and hurt individuals and their property, and no one with the slightest knowledge of Islam can doubt that this is an atrocious crime and grave sin."
        
        Two of the six had previously been jailed for their views, and at least two had reportedly associated with Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Separately, the country's religious authorities, led by Grand Mufti Sheik Abdulaziz al-Sheik, June 4 had issued a fatwa, or edict, calling on residents to report terrorist activity and on extremists to "come back to their senses."

    textlede: Bush balks at handing Saddam over to interim government; 'I just want to make sure that when sovereignty is transferred ... Saddam stays in jail'
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        George W. Bush, careful to protect his biggest catch in his 15-month war, has made it clear he is in no hurry to hand Saddam Hussein over to the uncertain security overseen by an interim Iraqi government.
        
        The U.S. president said yesterday it is in everyone's best interests to ensure the former Iraqi dictator faces justice for atrocities committed against his citizens and doesn't somehow avoid trial as Washington passes sovereignty to Iraqis in two weeks.
        
        "I just want to make sure that when sovereignty is transferred, Saddam Hussein ... stays in jail," Bush said after a White House meeting with Afghan President Hamid Karzai.
        
        Bush, however, was much more sanguine about the future of Moqtada al-Sadr, who U.S. military authorities had wanted "dead or alive" since his militia began deadly assaults against U.S. forces in Najaf earlier this spring. If the new Iraqi regime wants to bring him into the political process, that is their prerogative, Bush said,
        
        "When we say we transfer full sovereignty, we mean we transfer full sovereignty," Bush said.
        
        While Bush spoke, insurgents stepped up a campaign to undermine confidence in the incoming government, blasting two pipelines in the south of Iraq in a bid to cut off oil exports and attacking a convoy of foreign contractors, killing at least four.
        
        There was also an assassination of an Iraqi police official and a car bombing outside a coalition base near Hillah.
        
        And in Saudi Arabia, militants calling themselves al Qaeda in the Arabian peninsula threatened to kill an American hostage Paul Johnson, 49, unless Riyadh frees al Qaeda prisoners by Friday. The group, which claimed the killings of 22 foreign workers last month in the Saudi city of Khobar, posted a videotape of Johnson, blindfolded, on its website yesterday.
        
        With the clock ticking for the handover of greater security responsibilities to the Iraqi police, new concerns came to the fore about whether they could handle the job -- or would remain loyal to the interim government.
        
        AP reports Shiites, who were seeking refuge at a police station in the Sunni town of Falluja earlier this week, were instead handed over to extremists who killed at least six of them.
        
        After a car bombing which killed 13 Monday, Iraqi police stood by as mobs burned U.S. flags, chanted anti-American slogans and set the destroyed cars on fire. One officer told the New York Times they could not intervene because if the crowd thought they were aiding Americans, they would kill them.
        
        Bush acknowledged the security problems yesterday.
        
        "The Iraqi people are going to have to figure out how to make sure their country is secure enough for a free government to emerge," he said.
        
        Iyad Allawi, interim Iraqi prime minister, said yesterday that the interim government was anxious to take responsibility for Saddam and other detainees as soon as possible.Bush, in effect, said not so fast.
        
        "We want to make sure that he doesn't come back to power," Bush said.
        
        "And so therefore, it's a legitimate question to ask of the interim government -- 'How are you going to make sure he stays in jail?'
        
        "And that's the question I'm asking. And when we get the right answer, which I'm confident we will, we're going to work with them to do so, then we'll all be satisfied."

    textlede: Kidnappers of American Threaten to Kill Him in 3 Days
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Islamic militants holding an American engineer hostage in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday threatened to execute him within 72 hours unless the kingdom released the group's fighters from jail.
        
        In film posted on an Islamist Web site, the blindfolded hostage, Paul Marshall Johnson Jr., haltingly repeats his full name and says that he is an American and that he works on Apache helicopters. Shown from the side in the greenish light of a night vision camera, Mr. Johnson, 49, has a dragonlike tattoo visible on his left biceps where his shirt has been torn away.
        
        The posting includes both a written threat from the group, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- which is believed to be inspired by Osama bin Laden's terror network, rather than an official arm of it -- and a videotaped recording echoing the same Friday deadline by Abdelaziz al-Muqrin, the self-proclaimed leader of the group.
        
        "If the tyrannical Saudi government wants their American master to be released, then they have to release our holy warriors that are held in Hair, Ruweis and Alisha prisons within 72 hours of this statement's date," the statement reads.
        
        "Or else we will sacrifice his blood to God in revenge for our Muslim brothers who have been liberally killed everywhere."
        
        Hundreds of militants are held in the three Saudi jails mentioned, although the exact number is unclear.
        
        Since late last fall, 400 to 500 militants had been detained, according to an interview in April with Sayid A. al-Harthi, the senior adviser to Prince Nayef, the interior minister. But other analysts now put the number at twice that, with some 350 men arrested who are believed willing to carry out attacks and 600 to 700 sympathizers eager to offer cars, safe houses and other logistical support.
        
        Starting last year, the often secretive Saudi government took the unprecedented step of printing posters with the pictures of the 26 most-wanted terrorists, slapping them up on pillars around big cities and offering a reward for the militants' capture. One turned himself in, seven have been killed and the remaining 18 are still at large.
        
        They include Mr. Muqrin, who has issued repeated statements in recent months taunting the Saudi government for its inability to rein in the militants. A veteran fighter in Afghanistan and Bosnia, he claimed responsibility for an attack in the oil hub of Khobar on May 29 that killed 22 people, including 19 foreigners, vowing to make the coming months "bloody and miserable for infidels" so that they would all quit the birthplace of Islam.
        
        The statement posted late Tuesday on the Web site -- one used to post such claims before -- says the holy warriors of the Arabian peninsula's Falluja Brigade struck the engineering team that "oversees the development of the American Apache helicopter that attacks Muslims in Palestine and Afghanistan."
        
        The statement took credit for killing what it called the director of the team and kidnapping an engineer. The statement on Saturday announcing the kidnapping had threatened to treat Mr. Johnson like the American military treated Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib, and one picture of him released Tuesday showed him sitting with most of his upper body exposed except for what looked like strands of an orange shirt torn away.
        
        "The blood of Muslims is being spilled all over the globe and by the will of God, the blood of this parasite will flow in the rivers of blood of Crusaders that will run this blessed year," the statement said.
        
        "Muslims in the East and the West, we took a vow upon ourselves to make you victorious and we will not fail. God has unleashed the mujahedeen upon the Crusaders."
        
        Within hours of Mr. Johnson's kidnapping last Saturday, another American, Kenneth Scroggs, was shot and killed outside his Riyadh home. Mr. Scroggs was the business development manager for Advanced Electronics, a Saudi company with several contracts to manufacture elements for electronic warfare systems.
        
        Mr. Johnson worked in Saudi Arabia for the past decade in cooperation with Lockheed Martin on the Apache helicopter. A spokesman for the company in the United States said that it was up to the State Department and not Lockheed Martin to respond to the specific demands on the tape, but that the company and its employees sought to extend their concerns and their prayers to the family. Mr. Johnson's family could not be immediately reached for their reaction.
        
        It seemed unlikely that either the Saudi or the American government would broach negotiations with a terrorist group affiliated with Al Qaeda.
        
        "It shows the cruel and inhumane face of the enemy we're dealing with," Adel al-Jubeir, a foreign policy adviser to Crown Prince Abdullah, said on CNN, which first broadcast the tape from the Web site.
        
        The prince, the kingdom's de facto ruler, had vowed earlier Tuesday to step up the kingdom's fight against the terrorists to protect the millions of expatriates, including tens of thousands of Westerners, living there. Attacks since May 1 have killed 29 foreigners, including three gunned down in Riyadh in separate incidents last week. A BBC cameramen was shot dead and a correspondent critically wounded while filming in the poor Riyadh neighborhood that is home to many of the militants, including Mr. Muqrin.
        
        "Be assured that the kingdom has enough men whom you haven't seen so far, but within the coming few days you will see them," Prince Abdullah warned the militants in televised remarks on Tuesday.
        
        The tape the group released showed a high level of technical sophistication typical of its messages. Saudi security officers said that in raiding the group's hideouts they always find a certain duplication of organization -- three media centers, for example, instead of just one.

    textlede: Oil becomes terror's desperate weapon
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Things are not as they appear in the Middle East, for while on the surface things may look pretty bad, underneath they are much worse. And what looks so bad is really the one thing that is going right.
        
        Two nasty car bombings on successive days, a couple of high-level assassinations and numerous small sniping and other terrorist incidents, on top of unresolved constitutional squabbling between Kurds and Shiites, and intra-Shiite, and legal chaos surrounding the handover of Saddam Hussein and several thousand other key prisoners still in U.S. custody, have left the western and Arab media under the impression that the turnover of power to the new Iraqi government is somehow not going smoothly.
        
        Yet all these hits and complications are easily survivable for the new Iraqi state. They are just the background noise one must increasingly expect wherever Muslim "militants" are confronted with the possibility of an open society. The crescendo is building toward June 30 -- the formal date of transfer from Paul Bremer's administration to that of Prime Minister Iyad Illawi -- after which the Iraqi music will begin to fade.
        
        Less attention is given to the more worrying, longer-term development. In the vicinity of Basra -- which has been remarkably quiet, despite the best efforts of Muqtada al-Sadr's Shia blackshirts to stir up trouble -- two clever acts of sabotage have succeeded in cutting off most of Iraq's oil exports, for a couple of weeks. The saboteurs were most likely members of cells controlled by the Wahabi Islamist underground in neighbouring Saudi Arabia.
        
        The main terminal complex in Basra and a smaller one at Khor al-Amaya nearby had been loading 2.5 million barrels per day, a significant portion of the world's oil supply, and most of the new Iraq's income. The pipeline through Syria is down by policy, and that through the Kurdish north and Turkey (with a capacity well under one million barrels per day) has been cut to a trickle by frequent small terrorist hits.
        
        The problem here is that oil pipelines and facilities have become targets of choice. They were always fairly easy to hit, but as Arab psychopaths from Osama bin Laden down used to argue publicly, they must not be hit because they are the unique source of Arab wealth, power and prestige.
        
        To stop the flow of oil is to cut: 1. the ability of the "Arab nation" to hold the industrialized nations hostage; 2. their ability to fund the terror networks, and the parallel networks of Wahabi madrasas, mosques, charities and political fronts that proselytize for radical Islam across Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas. Worse (from an al-Qaeda point of view), the destruction of the oil weapon would mean, ultimately, 3. the loss of the Arab ability to shape, direct and define Islam for non-Arab Muslims in our post-modern world.
        
        Desperate times require desperate measures, however -- the Islamist "militants" have been, since Sept. 11, 2001, losing materially on almost every front -- and it is becoming clear that the leaders have been rethinking their approach. It becomes very clear, when one looks into Saudi Arabia and finds a purposeful strategy to "drive out the infidels" by assassinating carefully selected western technologists upon whom continuous Saudi oil production most depends.
        
        For two months now, the U.S. State Department, working on the premise that people's lives are more important than people's money, have been advising American nationals to get out of Saudi Arabia, in response to the terrorist campaign. They are in fact leaving, faster and faster. While the House of Saud can still contrive to pump oil at something like the current volume for a few months using Saudi nationals and the less skilled foreign workers not yet targeted, the oil infrastructure will then collapse. It depends entirely on American, Japanese and European expertise.
        
        This makes the possibility of a world oil crisis on a scale beyond anything experienced in 1974 or 1979 entirely thinkable in the coming winter. It explains why the U.S., Japan, Germany and other leading oil-dependent countries have been building inventories at an unprecedented rate, even at high current oil prices.
        
        There is another regional issue of some urgency: that Iran's ayatollahs are on the verge of obtaining nuclear weapons. That is very serious, and almost nothing is being done about it, in the runup to the U.S. presidential election. Call that potential Armageddon No. 1.
        
        But Armageddon No. 2 must also be considered: fanatical Arabs having decided, on behalf of all their brethren, that they must try to turn the world's oil supply into one big suicide bomb.

    textlede: No rush to hand over Saddam to Iraqis, Bush says
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        U.S. President George W. Bush, careful to protect his biggest catch in his 15-month war, has made it clear he is in no hurry to hand Saddam Hussein over to the uncertain security overseen by an interim Iraqi government.
        
        Bush said yesterday it was in everyone's best interests to ensure the former Iraqi dictator faces justice for atrocities committed against his citizens and doesn't somehow avoid trial as Washington passes sovereignty to Iraqis in two weeks.
        
        "I just want to make sure that when sovereignty is transferred, Saddam Hussein ... stays in jail," Bush said after a White House meeting with Afghan President Hamid Karzai.
        
        Bush, however, was much more sanguine about the future of Moqtada al-Sadr, who U.S. military authorities has wanted "dead or alive" since his militia began deadly assaults against U.S. forces in Najaf earlier this spring. If the new Iraqi regime wants to bring him into the political process, that is their prerogative, Bush said,
        
        "When we say we transfer full sovereignty, we mean we transfer full sovereignty," Bush said. While Bush spoke, insurgents stepped up a campaign to undermine confidence in the incoming government, blasting two pipelines in southern Iraq in a bid to cut off oil exports and attacking a convoy of foreign contractors, killing at least four. An Iraqi police official was killed and a car bomb went off outside a coalition base near Hilla.
        
        And there was trouble for Americans in neighbouring Saudi Arabia. Terrorists calling themselves Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula threatened to kill American hostage Paul Johnson, 49, unless Riyadh frees Al Qaeda prisoners by Friday. The group, which claimed the killings of 22 foreign workers last month in the Saudi city of Khobar, posted a videotape of Johnson, blindfolded, on its Web site yesterday.
        
        With the clock ticking for the handover of greater security responsibilities to the Iraqi police, new concerns came to the fore about whether they could handle the job and stay loyal to the interim government.
        
        reported yesterday that Shiites seeking refuge at a police station in the Sunni town of Falluja earlier this week were instead handed over to extremists who killed at least six of them.
        
        After a car bombing that killed 13 people on Monday, Iraqi police stood by as mobs burned U.S. flags, chanted anti-American slogans and set the destroyed cars on fire.
        
        Bush acknowledged the security problems yesterday.
        
        "The Iraqi people are going to have to figure out how to make sure their country is secure enough for a free government to emerge," he said.
        
        As June 30 approaches, 737,000 Iraqi government workers are already under direct Iraqi responsibility in 15 of 26 ministries, U.S. State Department spokesperson Richard Boucher said. Another 260,000 or more will be transferred to Iraqi responsibility in the next two weeks, he said.
        
        Ayad Allawi, the interim Iraqi prime minister, said earlier yesterday the government was anxious to take responsibility for Saddam and other detainees and promised a trial would be held as soon as possible.
        
        Bush, in effect, said not so fast.
        
        "We want to make sure that he doesn't come back to power," Bush said.
        
        "And so therefore, it's a legitimate question to ask of the interim government - 'How are you going to make sure he stays in jail?'
        
        "And that's the question I'm asking. And when we get the right answer, which I'm confident we will, we're going to work with them to do so, then we'll all be satisfied."
        
        Saddam was captured by U.S. forces last December and has been held by the Americans at an undisclosed location since then. He has been reported to be less than co-operative with his U.S. interrogators.
        
        A measure of Bush's pride in Saddam's capture is the former dictator's pistol, which sits in a study just off Bush's Oval Office at the White House. He said last week it was now U.S. property and he wasn't giving it back as part of the turnover of some powers to the Iraqis.
        
        Bush also jumped in yesterday to back Vice-President Dick Cheney, who at a Republican fundraiser on Monday, revived charges of links between Al Qaeda and Saddam, a perception the Bush administration has been happy to keep alive, even in the absence of proof.
        
        Bush had a one-word answer when asked about his evidence: "Zarqawi," he said.
        
        Abu Musab al-Zarqawi is believed to have beheaded American Nicholas Berg and his group claimed responsibility yesterday for Monday's car bombing in Baghdad.
        
        "Zarqawi's the best evidence of a connection to Al Qaeda affiliates and Al Qaeda," Bush said.
        
        "He's the person who's still killing."
        
        A new Gallup poll of Americans done for CNN showed 60 per cent of respondents say they believe things are going badly in Iraq and 57 per cent say they disapprove of Bush's handling of Iraq. The poll also showed 76 per cent of Republicans still say it was worth going to war, 76 per cent of Democrats say it was not.

        Saudi clerics condemn militant attacks
        
        RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- Six Saudi clerics who once espoused Islamic radicalism condemned a wave of attacks on Westerners, part of the kingdom's efforts to rally its people against al-Qaida's stepped-up campaign to oust the ruling family. The U.S. ambassador in Saudi Arabia met Monday with relatives of two Americans who were the latest victims of militant attacks: Kenneth Scroggs, who was gunned down in his garage, and Paul M. Johnson, who was kidnapped, reportedly after being drugged. Ambassador James Oberwetter said he expressed his condolences to Scroggs' widow and gave Johnson's wife "my hopes for his safe return."
        
        Oberwetter said he told the relatives that Saudi authorities have assured him they were "doing everything possible to resolve this kidnapping case."
        
        A group identifying itself as "al-Qaida in the Arabian peninsula" has claimed responsibility for the slaying and the kidnapping, as well as other attacks in recent weeks.

        Bush not wavering on stem-cell policy
        
        WASHINGTON -- The White House rejected calls Monday from Ronald Reagan's family and others to relax President Bush's restrictions on stem-cell research in pursuit of potential cures for illnesses. Bush signed an executive order in August 2001 that limited federal help to financing stem cell research on 78 embryonic stem-cell lines then in existence. Because day-old embryos are destroyed when stem cells are extracted, the process is opposed by some conservatives who link it to abortion. Shortly before Reagan's death, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry and 57 other senators asked Bush to relax the restrictions. Nancy Reagan has long argued that using stem cells from embryos could lead to cures for a number of diseases like Alzheimer's.
        
        Hundreds visit Reagan library
        
        SIMI VALLEY, Calif. -- President Ronald Reagan's hilltop library reopened Monday, admitting hundreds of admirers who solemnly stopped at his tomb in a Flag Day pilgrimage. About 300 people were in line when the library opened, and 1,272 had passed by the burial spot in the first two hours. Dressed casually, most in shorts and T-shirts, some brought flowers, most took snapshots, and several kissed the presidential seal and the entrance to the tomb. After his death, the library was closed for ceremonies, though the public was invited to pass by Reagan's casket in the lobby. About 106,000 people filed past the flag-draped casket during a 34-hour tribute June 7-8. Most waited in line for hours.
        
        Pakistan ends attack on al-Qaida hideouts
        
        ISLAMABAD Pakistan -- Pakistan claimed successes Monday on two fronts in its war on terrorism, ending an assault against al-Qaida hideouts near the Afghan border and announcing the arrest of the alleged mastermind of attacks on Shiites. The arrested man, Daud Badini, leads an al-Qaida-linked militant group, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, and police say he is a brother-in-law of Ramzi Yousef, who is serving a life term in the United States for the 1993 World Trade Center bombings. Badini was among 11 terrorist suspects -- also including a nephew of former al-Qaida No. 3, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed -- captured over the weekend in Karachi.
        
        Israel takes land for security barrier
        
        JERUSALEM -- Israel has expropriated thousands of acres of Palestinian farmland deep in the West Bank for the most controversial segment of its separation barrier, Palestinian officials said Monday. The military, meanwhile, said it is taking down a few of the roadblocks that have disrupted West Bank life for more than three years -- though the main obstacles to Palestinian travel remain in place. In violence Monday, an Israeli helicopter fired a missile into a car in the West Bank refugee camp of Balata, killing two Palestinians.
        
        Voters concerned about new methods
        
        The League of Women Voters rescinded its support of paperless voting machines on Monday after hundreds of angry members voiced concern that paper ballots were the only way to safeguard elections from fraud, hackers or computer malfunctions. About 800 delegates who attended the nonpartisan league's biennial convention in Washington voted overwhelmingly in favor of a resolution that supports "voting systems and procedures that are secure, accurate, recountable and accessible."
        
        About 30 percent of the electorate will use touchscreen voting machines in the November election. Hardly any of the machines provide paper records that could be used in case of a contested election.
        
        Army reveals new combat uniforms
        
        WASHINGTON -- The Army revealed on Monday a redesigned combat uniform with a digital camouflage pattern that looks strikingly different from soldiers' current battle dress uniforms. It marks the first major change in the Army uniform since 1981, said Brig. Gen. James Moran. He said recruits will be issued the redesigned uniform starting October 2005, and the entire Army will be outfitted by December 2007. The uniform is being produced in a single, universal pattern to replace the two current versions. The pattern for the new camouflage coat and trousers is a mix of light green, tan and gray. Moran said it was designed to allow soldiers to blend into urban, desert and forest environments.
        
        James Brown won't fight violence charge
        
        COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Entertainer James Brown told prosecutors in a letter received Monday that he would forgo a jury trial and not contest a domestic violence charge because he wanted to keep his family matters private. The 71-year-old Godfather of Soul was arrested in January and accused of pushing his wife, Tommie Rae Hynie.

    textlede: Terrorists take aim at Saudi allies: Killing foreigners seen as new tactic to drive U.S. out
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia
        
        With the kidnapping of an American and threats to inflict on him the same degrading punishments seen at Iraq's U.S.-run Abu Ghraib prison, suspected al-Qaeda terrorists appear to have unleashed a new tactic in their violent drive against Saudi Arabia's rulers.
        
        Saudi authorities searched Sunday for Paul M. Johnson, an American who was apparently abducted by militants who also claimed responsibility for gunning down another American in Riyadh, the day before.
        
        It was the third killing of a westerner in the Saudi capital in a week, part of a stepped up campaign aimed at driving out foreigners and sabotaging the oil sector, key to the Saudi economy and basis of the rule by the kingdom's royal family.
        
        The U.S. Embassy warned that the attacks appeared to follow extensive surveillance of the two Americans slain over the past week.
        
        Kenneth Scroggs was shot in the back as he parked in the garage at his home on Saturday. Last Tuesday, Robert Jacobs was also killed in his parking garage.
        
        The killings "involved extensive planning and preparation," a U.S. Embassy warden message said.
        
        "Often, this pre-attack surveillance can be detected."
        
        American defence contractors were beginning to leave Saudi Arabia Sunday night and British staff working with the Saudi military asked their employers if they could take immediate holidays with their families.
        
        The British Foreign Office told all of its non-essential staff and diplomats' families to leave the country. British Airways has banned its aircraft crews from staying overnight in Saudi Arabia.
        
        Paul M. Johnson, a 49-year-old US Apache military helicopter engineer, was kidnapped on Saturday.
        
        Al-Qaeda supporters used the same website -- "Sawt al Jihad" (Voice of Jihad) -- to boast that they had kidnapped Johnson, and showed his identity documents.
        
        Many western families were debating Sunday night whether it had become too dangerous to remain in the country.
        
        Worried families told The Times that they were asking their employers if they could begin their summer holidays immediately.
        
        Some Britons went further and resigned from their jobs at the weekend, although they face having to work long notice periods before Saudi officials will return their visas and allow them to leave.
        
        The expatriate community was particularly alarmed that the terrorists ambushed their victims outside their homes -- raising suspicions that Saudi work colleagues are passing addresses and other personal details to al-Qaeda cells.
        
        "You don't know who to trust any more," one British defence contractor said.
        
        "You look at Saudis you have worked with for years and those guarding our housing compound in Riyadh and you now wonder who is tipping off the terrorists.
        
        "All the attacks in the past week point heavily to the terrorists having inside information. They knew exactly where their targets lived and when they would be home. This place becomes more unbearable by the day."
        
        Al-Qaeda, led by Saudi-born Osama bin Laden, often rails against Saudi Arabia's rulers for their close links to the United States.
        
        "The Saudis know that this is an enemy that is coming after them. The killing of foreigners \.\.\. is a direct attack against the Saudi regime," U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell said on ABC's This Week.
        
        Powell said Saudi leaders are mobilizing all resources against militants but added, "I think that there is more that they can do."
        
        Charles Cutshaw, a former technical intelligence chief for the Marine Corps, said the attacks are designed to spread alarm among Americans to chase them out of the country.
        
        "You strike at weaknesses," he said a telephone interview.
        
        "They're going to strike at isolated individuals and put Americans in fear of their lives."
        
        Prince Bandar, the Saudi Ambassador to the United States, called the attacks on Americans "craven acts of evil."
        
        "Their intention is to shake our will, to frighten away our friends and allies, and to undermine our society," Bandar said.
        
        None of the gunmen have been caught in this week's fatal shootings of the two Americans and, on June 6, Irish cameraman Simon Cumbers.
        
        Saudi security officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said police stormed a suburban Riyadh house Sunday morning, arresting a man inside and confiscating a computer. It wasn't clear whether he was linked to any of the past week's shootings.
        
        The purported al-Qaeda statement, posted late Saturday on an Islamic website, threatened to treat Johnson, the abducted American, as U.S. troops treated Iraqi prisoners -- a reference to sexual and other abuses at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.
        
        It showed Johnson's passport and a Lockheed Martin business card bearing his name. The passport said Johnson was born in New Jersey. His son Paul Johnson III said his father moved to the kingdom in 1983 to work for Lockheed Martin.
        
        The al-Qaeda statement said Johnson is one of four experts in Saudi Arabia working on developing Apache attack helicopter systems.
        
        "Everybody knows that these helicopters are used by the Americans, their Zionist allies and the apostates to kill Muslims, terrorizing them and displacing them in Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq," said the statement. It said al-Qaeda would release a videotape later with Johnson's confessions and its demands.
        
        A car belonging to Johnson was found Saturday near Imam University, security officials said. Saudi press reports said the car was booby-trapped and later caught fire. The university is about 15 kilometres from the neighbourhood where Scroggs was shot.
        
        Lockheed Martin issued a statement confirmed that Johnson was missing. The U.S. Embassy said it was working with Saudi officials to find the kidnapped American.
        
        The statement claiming Saturday's shooting and kidnapping was signed by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the same group that claimed responsibility for a May 29-30 shooting spree and hostage-taking in the eastern Saudi oil hub of Khobar that killed 22 people, most foreigners.

    textlede: Embassy staff given right to quit Saudi: Fears for American kidnapped by al-Qaida in Riyadh
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Britain was radically scaling back its presence in Saudi Arabia last night as authorities combed the capital, Riyadh, for an American who was apparently kidnapped by al-Qaida within hours of another westerner being shot dead.
        
        The Foreign Office gave all non-essential staff and their families permission to return home, while British Airways said its flight crews would no longer spend nights in Saudi Arabia because the airline feared for their safety. BA will land in Kuwait instead, then make short-haul trips to Riyadh.
        
        The Islamist militants who claimed responsibility for abducting Paul Johnson, an employee of the defence firm Lockheed Martin, threatened to use him to avenge prison abuses by the US military.
        
        "(We) reserve the legitimate right to deal with the Americans in the same way to avenge what the Americans did to our brothers in Abu Ghraib prison and Guantanamo," read a statement on the Sawt al Jihad website, attributed to " al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula". As proof, they included an image of a driving licence and business card seemingly belonging to Mr Johnson, whom they called "an American Christian parasite".
        
        One report from Riyadh last night said Saudi security officials had discovered a man's body, possibly a westerner, but the country's police chief was quoted as denying the rumour.
        
        Nervousness among foreigners in Saudi Arabia was already at an unprecedented pitch after the killing of three westerners since the start of the month. One was the 36-year-old Irish television cameraman Simon Cumbers, whose colleague, BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner, remains seriously ill in hospital with bullet wounds.
        
        Two days after Mr Cumbers was shot, Robert Jacobs, an American adviser to Saudi Arabia's national guard, was killed. The national guard protects the pro-Washington royal family, and is closely identified with western interests.
        
        Then, on Saturday evening, a second US defence contractor was gunned down by three men as he parked his car in a Riyadh suburb. Washington has not publicly released his name, but a government source confirmed that he was Kenneth Scroggs, who worked for a firm selling electronic equipment to the military.
        
        "The mojahedin were able\.\.\. to kill another American working as a manager in the military sector," the Sawt al Jihad website boasted.
        
        "They stalked him and then they killed him in his home."
        
        The site also linked to a grisly video purporting to show the execution of "the Jewish-American Robert Jacobs". In the footage, a voice is heard screaming "No, no, please!" in English, then, after the sound of a gunshot, the body of a man slumps to the ground. Two men then fire at least 10 more shots at his body.
        
        As the search for Mr Johnson continued into the night yesterday, Lockheed Martin refused to confirm or deny the kidnappers' claim that he played a senior role in developing one of the firm's most important products, the Apache attack helicopter.
        
        Osama bin Laden has threatened to make 2004 a "bloody and miserable" year for Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest source of oil. The ruling royal family's closeness to the United States outrages Islamist militants.
        
        American critics of the Bush administration accuse the White House of sacrificing its security to its alliance with Riyadh, and Mr Powell yesterday sought to steer a middle course, praising the Saudi leadership while urging it to do more.
        
        "I am satisfied with what they have done," he told ABC.
        
        "I think there is more that they can do" - including cutting funds "to the kinds of organisations that might have given comfort to these sorts of terrorist activities."
        
        The British government denied that its decision to allow embassy staff to leave was a panicked response to the weekend's killing and abduction."It's not based on what's happened in the last 24 hours, it's based on considering many things that have happened\.\.\. It's up to them whether they want to leave or not."
        
        The US evacuated all non-essential embassy staff from the country in April.

        The Islamist militants who claimed responsibility for abducting Paul Johnson, an employee of the defence firm Lockheed Martin, threatened to use him to avenge prison abuses by the US military.
        
        "(We) reserve the legitimate right to deal with the Americans in the same way to avenge what the Americans did to our brothers in Abu Ghraib prison and Guantanamo," read a statement on the Sawt al-Jihad website, attributed to " al-Qaida in the Arabian peninsula".
        
        As proof of the kidnap they included an image of a driving licence and business card apparently belonging to Mr Johnson, whom they called "an American Christian parasite".
        
        One report from Riyadh last night said Saudi security officials had discovered a man's body, possibly a westerner's, but the police chief was quoted as denying the rumour.
        
        Adam Ereli, deputy spokes-man for the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, told the Guardian: "We've got a report of a missing American, and we have reports that the American is being held by groups claiming affiliation with al-Qaida \.\.\. but we haven't talked to the American, or to the kidnappers."
        
        Nervousness among foreigners in Saudi Arabia was already at an unprecedented pitch after the killing of three westerners this month. One was a 36-year-old Irish television cameraman, Simon Cumbers, whose colleague, the BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner, remains seriously ill in hospital with bullet wounds.
        
        Two days after Mr Cumbers was shot, Robert Jacobs, an American adviser to Saudi Arabia's national guard, was killed. And on Saturday evening a second US defence contractor, believed to be Kenneth Scroggs, was gunned down in a Riyadh suburb. Mr Scroggs worked for a firm selling electronic equipment to the military.
        
        "The mojahedin were able\.\.\. to kill another American working as a manager in the military sector," the Sawt al-Jihad website said.
        
        "They stalked him and then they killed him in his home."
        
        The site also linked to a video purporting to show the execution of "the Jewish-American Robert Jacobs". In the footage a voice is heard screaming, "No, no, please", in English, then, after the sound of a gunshot, the body of a man slumps to the ground. Two men then fire at least 10 more shots at his body.
        
        As the search for Mr Johnson continued into the night yesterday, Lockheed Martin refused to confirm or deny the kidnappers' claim that he played a senior role in dev-eloping one of the firm's most important products, the Apache attack helicopter.
        
        "It is not a secret that these planes (sic) have long been used by the Americans and their Zionist allies and the apostates in killing Muslims, terrorising them and displacing them in Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq," the online statement read.
        
        The defence firm, based just outside Washington in Bethesda in Maryland, would only say that Mr Johnson was an employee.
        
        "We have no first-hand knowledge of this kidnapping," a spokesman added.
        
        Osama bin Laden has threatened to make 2004 a "bloody and miserable" year for Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest source of oil. The ruling royal family's closeness to the US outrages Islamist militants.
        
        The British government denied that its decision to allow embassy staff to leave was a panicky response to the weekend's killing and abduction.
        
        "Having kept the decision under constant review, the decision has been taken to authorise voluntary departure," a spokesman said.
        
        "It's not based on what's happened in the last 24 hours, it's based on considering many things that have happened\.\.\. It's up to them whether they want to leave or not."
        
        The US evacuated all non-essential embassy staff from the country in April.
        
        "We're pretty down to the bone," an American spokesman in Riyadh said yesterday.

        DATELINE: RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA
        
        U.S. and Saudi authorities are searching for an American apparently abducted by al-Qaeda-linked militants. The abductors threatened to treat the man, Paul Johnson, the way U.S. troops mistreated prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.
        
        A statement purporting to be from al-Qaeda also claimed responsibility for Saturday's gunning down of American Kenneth Scroggs, 58, in the Saudi capital, the second such killing in a week.
        
        Several Islamic Web sites also carried links to a videotape, purportedly from al-Qaeda, that claim to show Tuesday's killing of American Robert Jacobs.
        
        In Iraq, assassins gunned down an official with the new Iraqi government yesterday, while a car bomb killed at least 12 Iraqis near an American military base.
        
        With car bombings occurring at a rate of more than one per day, the bloodshed is expected to build as America prepares to hand over power to the new Iraqi leadership June 30.
        
        The Saudi kidnapping, the first of a westerner in the kingdom, appeared to be a new tactic in a campaign of violence believed aimed at sabotaging the vital Saudi oil sector. Some 8.8 million foreigners work among 17 million Saudis in the kingdom, mostly in the oil sector, banking and other high-level businesses.
        
        Word of the abduction of Johnson -- employed in Saudi Arabia since 1983 by defence contractor Lockheed Martin -- came hours after Scroggs was shot in the back as he parked in the garage at his home.
        
        The alleged al-Qaeda statement said Johnson, 49, is one of four experts in Saudi Arabia working on developing Apache attack helicopter systems and that Scroggs worked in the same industry.
        
        A Saudi security source said that Scroggs worked for Advanced Electronics Co., a Saudi firm whose web site lists Lockheed Martin among its customers.
        
        Jacobs, 62, of Murphysboro, Ill., was a graphics designer for the Vinnell Corp., which has a contract with the U.S. Army to train members of the Saudi National Guard.
        
        Referring to Johnson's work, the tape said: "Everybody knows that these helicopters are used by the Americans, their Zionist allies and the apostates to kill Muslims, terrorizing them and displacing them in Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq."
        
        It said al-Qaeda would release a videotape later with Johnson's confessions and its demands.
        
        The pan-Arab TV station Al-Jazeera aired parts of a tape yesterday, showing two men surprising Jacobs as he tried to park in front of his garage, then showing Jacob writhing on the ground as an attacker fired from a hand gun.
        
        The video, less than two minutes long, begins with men running in a garage and a voice yelling in English, "No, no, please!" A shot is fired, and the body of what appears to be a western man falls to the ground.
        
        Two gunmen fire at least 10 more shots at the fallen man, then one kneels by his head and motions as if he is beheading him.
        
        The statement and the videotape were attributed to al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. There was no way to verify their authenticity. The same group claimed responsibility for a shooting and hostage-taking spree in the eastern Saudi city of Khobar on May 29-30. That attack in the hub of the Saudi oil industry killed 22 people, mostly foreigners.
        
        The British Embassy in Saudi Arabia announced yesterday it was authorizing the voluntary departure of non-essential staff and their families.
        
        British Airways also announced that its flight crews will no longer stay overnight in Saudi Arabia because of security problems.
        
        The United States has urged all its citizens to leave the kingdom.
        
        In Iraq, the U.S. Army said there have been as many as 15 car bombs so far this month. Attacks on the American-led coalition forces continue running at 35 or 40 a day. That is lower than the 100 attacks a day that the military experienced in April but still high compared to most months.
        
        Iraqi leaders, chosen with the approval of U.S. officials, are to accept sovereignty on June 30 in an interim government scheduled to hold elections within seven months. American officials had hoped that might take some of the wind out of the insurgency.
        
        Now many predict a surge in violence leading up to the handover and afterwards. One of the primary targets appears to be the new government itself.
        
        Kamal al-Jarah, a 63-year-old education ministry official, was driving out of his driveway yesterday morning when masked assassins at his gate opened fire, according to Iraqi police Brig. Sabah Fahed Al-Obeidi. He said there were several shots fired through al-Jarah's windshield. Al-Obeidi said that Al-Jarah was alone in his car.
        
        The attack was in the Ghazaliyeh neighbourhood, a Sunni Muslim area of northwest Baghdad. The area is, according to army spokesmen, one of the most frequent locations of attacks on U.S. troops in the city.
        
        On Saturday, Iraqi Deputy Foreign Minister Bassam Kubba was killed by assassins who drove up and fired into to his car as he left his house for work.
        
        Kubba was one of Iraq's most senior diplomats and had served as the head of the country's mission at the United Nations and in China under the rule of Saddam Hussein.
        
        Kubba also had little, if any security. A neighbour said he had a couple guards at his house but no one except a driver traveled with him.
        
        Iraqi government ministers usually have a team of Iraqi security guards with them but lower officials are not usually afforded protection, perhaps because the new government is still organizing its offices.
        
        American officials say the coalition offers to train Iraqi guards for government figures but Iraqis complain that it often takes too long for such arrangements to be worked out.
        
        Wire services reported three other assassinations or attempts. Late Saturday night, a prominent Kurdish cleric, Iyad Khorshid, was killed. The city is mixed and disputed between Kurds, Arabs and Turkmen and there have been several assassinations of leaders among the three groups.
        
        Two police commanders were wounded in separate attacks in Baghdad and Baquoba, northeast of the capital.

    textlede: Al-Qaida unleashes new tactic in terror; Saudi attacks show extensive planning, U.S. Embassy says
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- With the kidnapping of an American and threats to inflict on him the same degrading punishments seen at Iraq's U.S.-run Abu Ghraib prison, suspected al-Qaida terrorists appear to have unleashed a new tactic in their violent drive against Saudi Arabia's rulers.
        
        Saudi authorities searched Sunday for Paul M. Johnson, an American who was apparently abducted by militants who also claimed responsibility for gunning down another American in Riyadh the day before.
        
        It was the third killing of a Westerner in the Saudi capital in a week, part of a stepped-up campaign aimed at driving out foreigners and sabotaging the oil sector, key to the Saudi economy and basis of the rule by the kingdom's royal family.
        
        The U.S. Embassy warned that the attacks appeared to follow extensive surveillance of the two Americans slain over the past week. Kenneth Scroggs was shot in the back as he parked in the garage at his home on Saturday. Robert Jacobs was killed Tuesday in his parking garage.
        
        The killings "involved extensive planning and preparation," a U.S. Embassy warden message said.
        
        "Often, this pre-attack surveillance can be detected."
        
        Al-Qaida, led by Saudi-born Osama bin Laden, often rails against Saudi Arabia's rulers for their close links to the United States.
        
        "The Saudis know that this is an enemy that is coming after them. The killing of foreigners ... is a direct attack against the Saudi regime," U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell said on ABC's "This Week."
        
        Powell said Saudi leaders are mobilizing all resources against militants but added, "I think that there is more that they can do."
        
        The Saudis can "build up their forces" and cut off funding for militants, he said on "Fox News Sunday."
        
        "There's probably more we can do with respect to intelligence exchange, and we are working at all of these," he said.
        
        Prince Bandar, the Saudi Ambassador to the United States, called the attacks on Americans "craven acts of evil."
        
        None of the gunmen have been caught in last week's fatal shootings of the two Americans and, on June 6, Irish cameraman Simon Cumbers.
        
        The purported al-Qaida statement, posted late Saturday on an Islamic Web site, threatened to treat Johnson, the abducted American, as U.S. troops treated Iraqi prisoners -- a reference to sexual and other abuses at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.
        
        It showed Johnson's passport and a Lockheed Martin business card bearing his name. The passport said Johnson was born in New Jersey. His son, Paul Johnson III, said his father moved to the kingdom in 1983 to work for Lockheed Martin.
        
        The al-Qaida statement said Johnson is one of four experts in Saudi Arabia working on developing Apache attack helicopter systems. It said al-Qaida would release a videotape later with Johnson's confessions and its demands.
        
        A car belonging to Johnson was found Saturday near Imam University, security officials said. Saudi press reports said the car was booby-trapped and later caught fire. The university is about 12 miles from the neighborhood where Scroggs was shot.
        
        Paul Johnson III, of Port St. John, Fla., asked the kidnappers to let his father go.
        
        "He doesn't deserve it. It's not his fault he's over there. It's his job," he said on NBC News.
        
        The militant attacks against Westerners, government targets and economic interests in the kingdom have surged despite a high-profile campaign against terrorists that the government began after suicide bombings last year.
        
        Terror experts have noted that the militants are using several tactics -- including shootings and ambushes where the gunmen do not die -- rather than limiting themselves to suicide bombings or swift attacks under the cover of darkness.
        
        The statement claiming Saturday's shooting and kidnapping was signed by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, the same group that claimed responsibility for a May 29-30 shooting spree and hostage-taking in the eastern Saudi oil hub of Khobar that killed 22 people, mostly foreigners.
        
        Saudi security arrested one attacker in Khobar, but three others escaped.
        
        Saudi Arabia relies heavily on a foreign work force. An estimated 8.8 million foreigners work among 17 million Saudis in the kingdom, some in the oil sector, banking and other high-level businesses, but the majority in service industry jobs such as maids, bell boys or taxi drivers.

    textlede: 'Dangerous time for Saudi Arabia': Powell: Security forces hunt for terrorists behind killings, kidnapping
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        U.S. and Saudi Arabian security forces were hunting yesterday for an al-Qaeda-linked group that appeared to have claimed responsibility this weekend for the kidnapping of an American worker and the killing of two others in Riyadh.
        
        A written statement by a group calling itself "al-Qaeda in the Arabian peninsula " claimed responsibility for the hostage- taking of Paul Johnson, a 49-year-old aeronautics engineer, and the murder of Kenneth Scroggs, a colleague of Mr. Johnson, who was gunned down outside his home on Saturday.
        
        A group using the same name posted a video yesterday showing the killing of Robert Jacob, a Jewish American who was shot dead last Tuesday in Riyadh.
        
        Saudi and U.S. officials hope to find Mr. Johnson and avert another death in an escalating terrorist campaign that appears to be aimed at destabilizing the government of Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally and the world's largest oil exporter.
        
        "Clearly this is a dangerous time for Saudi Arabia and we're working with them and co-operating with them in every way we can to defeat the terrorists," Colin Powell, the U.S. Secretary of State, said in one of several television interviews yesterday.
        
        "The Saudis know that this is an enemy that is coming after them ... The killing of foreigners, whether they're Americans or Brits or what are they, is a direct attack against the Saudi regime," he said in another interview.
        
        In response to the hostage- taking and an attack two weeks ago in which 22 people, including a British citizen, were killed, the British and U.S. governments have removed all non-essential embassy staff from Saudi Arabia. The U.S. embassy took the unusual step of urging its citizens to vary their schedules and keep a low profile to thwart surveillance by terrorists.
        
        "Vary your times and routes to and from destinations whenever possible. Do not have a set day for shopping, errands and personal needs," the statement said.
        
        "Be unpredictable in your work and social schedules. Unpredictable targets are hard targets... In traffic, always try to leave space in which to manoeuvre. Do not get boxed in; always leave yourself an exit.
        
        "When stopped in traffic, think about what you would do if an incident occurred. Be prepared to take evasive action at any time."
        
        Last week, Ottawa issued a warning advising Canadians not to travel to Saudi Arabia. The Department of Foreign Affairs is monitoring developments and could advise the approximately 7,000 Canada citizens in Saudi Arabia to leave if the threat escalates.
        
        A statement posted to an Islamist Web site said Mr. Johnson, 49, is one of four experts in Saudi Arabia working on developing Apache helicopter systems, and that Mr. Scroggs worked in the same industry. The two are believed to have worked for state-controlled Advanced Electronics.
        
        "Everybody knows that these helicopters are used by the Americans, their Zionist allies and the apostates to kill Muslims, terrorizing them and displacing them in Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq," said the written statement. It said al-Qaeda would release a videotape later with Mr. Johnson's "confession" and its demands.
        
        Mr. Johnson's son, Paul Johnson of Florida, told NBC News his father moved to Saudi Arabia in 1983 to work for aerospace contractor Lockheed Martin.
        
        "Get my dad home safely," he said, addressing the kidnappers.
        
        "He doesn't deserve this. My father's a good man. I wish the Gulf War hadn't happened. It's not just my father. Everybody is losing their lives."
        
        Lockheed Martin confirmed the senior Mr. Johnson was an employee but would not discuss his responsibilities for fear of jeopardizing his safe return.
        
        Security officials said an abandoned car found on Saturday near Imam University belonged to Mr. Johnson. It was found to be booby-trapped and caught fire.
        
        The videotape of Mr. Jacobs' killing begins with a voice saying, "No, no. Please."
        
        It then shows an unidentified man who appears to be a Westerner. He is shot once and falls to the ground. After he falls, 10 more shots are fired into him before one of his attackers kneels by his head and motions as if he is going to behead the man.
        
        "The murder of the Jewish American Robert Jacob, who worked for the Vinnell espionage firm," said a statement announcing the video on the Web site. Mr. Jacobs, 62, was working for a unit of Northrop Grumman Corp. training the Saudi National Guard, an elite force that protects the Saudi monarchy.
        
        Terrorists have also killed Irish BBC cameraman Simon Cumbers and two U.S. businessmen in Saudi Arabia in the past week. Frank Gardner, the BBC's security correspondent, was still in a coma yesterday after being seriously wounded in the shooting on June 6.
        
        The killings are part of a wave of attacks on foreigners that have included government targets and economic interests in the kingdom. Al-Qaeda has admitted its intention is to create an atmosphere of fear among the expatriate community that it hopes will lead to their departure and the disruption of the vital oil sector.
        
        The kidnapping of Mr. Johnson "may represent a new tactic" in the Saudi terrorists' campaign to get foreigners to leave the kingdom, said Carol Kalin, a U.S. embassy spokeswoman in Saudi Arabia. No Westerner has been kidnapped in Saudi Arabia "for as long as I can remember," she said.
        
        The insurgents' tactics are becoming more sophisticated and are increasingly similar to those being implemented in Iraq, analysts said. Last month, Nicholas Berg, a U.S. businessman looking to pick up lucrative Iraq reconstruction contracts, was beheaded on a gruesome videotape seen around the world.
        
        Mr. Berg's killing was seen as retaliation for the abuse of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad, a scandal that is widely viewed in the Middle East as emblematic of U.S. interference in the region. Mr. Johnson's captors also threatened to abuse him as Iraqi prisoners were abused.
        
        Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador to the United States, called the killing and kidnapping "craven acts of evil."
        
        "The actions of the terrorists represent the misguided nature of the few people who want to stop the movement toward progress and modernity in the kingdom," he said in a statement yesterday.
        
        "Their intention is to shake our will, to frighten away our friends and allies and to undermine our society. We are at war with these terrorists and with their ideology of hate. And we will succeed."
        
        However, Mr. Powell told Fox News yesterday he believes the Saudi regime can do more to stop the attacks. He suggested building up the country's security forces, cutting off funding for terrorists and improving the exchange of intelligence.

    textlede: Saudi Security Forces Search for a Missing American
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        The Saudi Arabian security services hunted Sunday for an American electronics engineer believed kidnapped in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, during a seemingly choreographed operation in which one of his American colleagues was shot dead elsewhere in the city.
        
        The kidnapping, which would be the first of its kind in Saudi Arabia, and the rising toll of dead Westerners raise the stakes in the militants' goal of driving non-Muslims from the kingdom, damaging its economy and causing the collapse of the ruling family.
        
        Most of the details about the kidnapping of the American, Paul M. Johnson Jr., a specialist in Apache helicopters who is originally from New Jersey, came from a statement posted on an Islamist Web site by a group called Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which has claimed responsibility for much of the violence of the past two months.
        
        "They don't really know much about it right now," the man's son, Paul M. Johnson III, said in a telephone interview from Florida, referring to efforts by the State Department and the Saudi authorities to find his father.
        
        "They said that they are trying to follow leads."
        
        The younger Mr. Johnson said he spoke to his father last weekend and although his father expressed concerns about the mounting violence, he did not say anything about being worried about his own safety.
        
        Mr. Johnson, an employee of Lockheed Martin, had worked in Saudi Arabia at a local company whose specialty included manufacturing elements of electronic warfare systems. One of the company's American employees, Kenneth Scroggs, was shot in the back outside his home in a Riyadh residential neighborhood on Saturday afternoon, becoming the third Westerner gunned down in a week and the 29th killed since May 1.
        
        A statement on Sunday from the company, Advanced Electronics, said the slain man was the firm's business development manager, who had worked there for 12 years, training some of its Saudi staff members. Advanced Electronics was portrayed on the Web site of the Saudi Embassy in Washington as an example of a successful small Saudi private company.
        
        But what apparently drew the attention of the militants was the company's work with military aircraft, specifically the Apache helicopter.
        
        "Everybody knows that these helicopters are used by the Americans, their Zionist allies and the apostates to kill Muslims, terrorizing them and displacing them in Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq," said the Web site statement by the group claiming responsibility for the kidnapping.
        
        The man who was kidnapped, Mr. Johnson, 49, had a picture of an Apache helicopter on his business card, which was posted on the Web site notice announcing his abduction, along with a Saudi driver's license that said he worked in a military area. The card listed his specialties, including a pilot night-vision system for the helicopters.
        
        The kidnappers' statement threatened Mr. Johnson with violence like that suffered by Iraqi prisoners held by the American military at Abu Ghraib prison. It referred to him as a Christian "parasite," using an obscure Arabic word made popular by the former spokesman for Saddam Hussein's government.
        
        Mr. Johnson's business card identified him as an employee of Lockheed Martin, but the telephone number was for Advanced Electronics. The company did not respond to telephone or e-mail messages on Sunday.
        
        In the United States, Lockheed Martin confirmed that Mr. Johnson was an employee and was believed kidnapped, but a company spokesman had no other details.
        
        The militants' statement said Mr. Johnson was one of four experts in Saudi Arabia working on the helicopter systems. Mr. Johnson, whose son said he had worked in the kingdom for more than a decade, was apparently grabbed from his car, which was found abandoned.
        
        In addition to his son, Mr. Johnson has a daughter, three grandchildren and a former wife living in Florida. His current wife, a Thai citizen, was with him in Saudi Arabia, his son said.
        
        "It is just a wait-and-see thing," said the younger Mr. Johnson, 28.
        
        "I am praying that everything is going to work out. I just want him to be safe."
        
        The militants' Web site statement did not identify Mr. Scroggs, but noted that the other American had been killed at his house.
        
        The kidnapping and killing showed signs of careful planning, as the American Embassy noted in a new statement to residents warning them about the growing threat.
        
        "The recent terrorist attacks on Westerners in Riyadh appear to have involved extensive planning and preparation and were likely preceded by extensive pre-attack surveillance," the embassy said in a warning to all American citizens to be on the lookout for strangers following them.
        
        Only one militant has been arrested in a string of violent attacks, including four recent shootings in Riyadh and the attack on a Western expatriate compound in Khobar on May 29, which left 22 people dead, including 19 foreigners. One of the four Saudi gunmen was captured but the others have eluded capture.
        
        Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, appearing on Sunday news programs in the United States, said there was a "dangerous situation" in Saudi Arabia but that the country was not unraveling. He said the Saudis could be doing more to fight terrorism, but praised their efforts thus far.
        
        "They can build up their forces; there is probably more that we can do with respect to intelligence exchange," Mr. Powell said on "Fox News Sunday."
        
        The American Embassy greatly reduced its staff in April and suggested then that all Americans leave.
        
        "The Saudis now know that they have a very serious problem within the kingdom and they know that it is going to require all their resources -- not only their military and police resources," Mr. Powell said.
        
        "They have to cut off funding to the kinds of organizations that might have given comfort to these sorts of terrorists activities."
        
        Material posted on Islamist Web sites late Saturday included images that seemed to show the shooting death of a third American, Robert Jacobs, 62, apparently singled out because he worked for the Vinnell Corporation, an American company training the Saudi National Guard.
        
        Mr. Jacobs was killed last Tuesday at his home in Riyadh. The short videotape, introduced as the "beheading of a Jewish American," opens inside a garage in which a man is heard yelling in English, "No, no, please!" before shots ring out and a heavyset Westerner tumbles to the ground in one corner of the frame.
        
        Two gunmen then rush to his side and fire an additional 10 or so shots into the man's back, then kneel and make a cutting motion as if beheading him. Everything was filmed from the back of the action, and there were no reports at the time that Mr. Jacobs had been beheaded. It was impossible to verify the authenticity of the videotape.
        
        The violence over the past six weeks has prompted a steady stream of Westerners to quit Saudi Arabia, although it is difficult to gauge the extent of the flow, and American businesspeople say it has not become an exodus. The kingdom, with a population of 17 million people, relies on some 6 million foreign workers, but most are laborers.
        
        The approximately 35,000 Americans and 30,000 Britons are the largest Western groups, most working in the oil or financial sectors. Westerners tend to be employed in the more technical engineering aspects of oil production, like oil field management, so their departure would not immediately affect the vast Saudi oil output, but might in the longer term.

    textlede: Fears grow for missing N.J. native; Engineer believed abducted in Saudi Arabia
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        U.S. and Saudi authorities reported no leads late Sunday in the search for Paul M. Johnson, an American contractor believed to be a hostage of al-Qaeda militants operating in Riyadh.
        
        In Ocean County, meanwhile, Johnson's relatives and friends pleaded for the return of a man who told his family about the dangers of living and working overseas.
        
        "He never did anything wrong," said his brother, Wayne Johnson of Manahawkin.
        
        "He's a straight and narrow guy. Even if he drank beer, he was careful."
        
        Paul Johnson, an engineer for Lockheed Martin, may be the latest target in a violent drive against Saudi Arabia's rulers and economy. He disappeared Saturday, the same day another American contractor, Kenneth Scroggs, was shot to death in the Saudi capital.
        
        In the past week, another American and an Irishman were killed in the kingdom. Al-Qaeda militants - who routinely rail against Saudi Arabian rulers for their relationship with the United States - have claimed responsibility in each case.
        
        A purported al-Qaeda statement, posted late Saturday on an Islamic Web site, included a passport and photo of Paul Johnson and a Lockheed Martin business card bearing his name. The statement threatened to treat him as U.S. troops treated Iraqi prisoners - a reference to abuses at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.
        
        The passport said Johnson was born in New Jersey. His son, Paul Johnson III of Port St. John, Fla., said his father had worked in the kingdom for more than a decade.
        
        "He doesn't deserve it. It's not his fault he's over there. It's his job," he said on NBC News. He said he was heading to New Jersey to be with family members.
        
        "I would do anything I could to switch places with him in a heartbeat," said the younger Johnson, a drywall contractor who has a 3-year-old son whom Paul M. Johnson hasn't met.
        
        The younger Johnson said his father had been nervous about being in Saudi Arabia.
        
        "My dad's probably praying, wondering how he got himself into this and how he can get himself out," he said.
        
        Saudi Arabia relies heavily on a foreign workforce, with an estimated 8.8 million foreigners employed in high-level business and service-industry jobs. Prior to the recent attacks in Riyadh, the U.S. Embassy had advised Americans to leave the kingdom.
        
        Paul M. Johnson grew up in the West Creek section of Eagleswood Township, his family said. He is an Air Force veteran who worked on radio systems for Apache helicopters. In addition to his son, he has a daughter, Tamara, and three grandchildren. His family said he was building his retirement home in Thailand, the native country of his second wife, Nam. He was supposed to visit the United States this month, but the trip was pushed back until the fall.
        
        His mother, Delores - who shares a mobile home with Wayne Johnson - was taken away Sunday by a daughter, Donna. The mother's home health aide, Barbara Pagliughi, remained behind and told reporters that Delores Johnson last heard from her son three weeks ago.
        
        "He would mention how you would have to check under your car for bombs," Pagliughi said.
        
        "He was used to that. He knows."
        
        A car belonging to Paul M. Johnson was found Saturday near Imam University, security officials said. Saudi press reports said the car was booby-trapped and later caught fire.
        
        The university is about 12 miles from the neighborhood where Scroggs was shot in the back Saturday as he parked his car in the garage at his home. On Tuesday, another American, Robert Jacobs, was killed in his parking garage. And on June 6, Irish cameraman Simon Cumbers was slain.
        
        In the statement released after Paul M. Johnson's disappearance, the alleged abductors referred to his work on the Apache helicopter.
        
        "Everybody knows that these helicopters are used by the Americans, their Zionist allies, and the apostates to kill Muslims, terrorizing them and displacing them in Palestine, Afghanistan, and Iraq," said the statement. It said al-Qaeda would release a videotape with Johnson's confessions and its demands.
        
        Lockheed Martin released a statement Sunday that said: "We believe he has been kidnapped, but we have no information on his status or whereabouts. We will continue to work with U.S. and Saudi government and military officials and the family of Mr. Johnson to provide any assistance possible. Our thoughts and prayers are with Paul Johnson and his family."
        
        Saudi security officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said police stormed a suburban Riyadh house Sunday morning, arresting a man inside and confiscating a computer. It wasn't clear whether he was linked to any of the past week's shootings.
        
        Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said Saudi leaders are mobilizing all resources against militants, but added: "I think that there is more that they can do."
        
        "The Saudis know that this is an enemy that is coming after them. The killing of foreigners ... is a direct attack against the Saudi regime," Powell said on ABC's "This Week."
        
        Prince Bandar, the Saudi ambassador to the United States, called the attacks on Americans "craven acts of evil."
        
        "Their intention is to shake our will, to frighten away our friends and allies, and to undermine our society," Bandar said.
        
        The statement claiming Saturday's shooting and kidnapping was signed by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the same group that took responsibility for a May 29-30 shooting spree and hostage-taking in the eastern Saudi oil hub of Khobar. The spree killed 22 people, most of them foreigners.
        
        Meanwhile, several Islamic Web sites were carrying links to a videotape - also purportedly from al-Qaeda - that claims to show last Tuesday's killing of Jacobs, 62, of Murphysboro, Ill., who worked for U.S. defense contractor Vinnell Corp.
        
        The video, less than two minutes long, does not show any faces. It begins with men running in a garage and a voice yelling in English, "No, no, please!" A shot is fired, and the body of what appears to be a Western man falls to the ground. Two gunmen fire at least 10 more shots at the fallen man, then one kneels by his head and motions as if he is beheading him.
        
        A woman who identified herself only as Jacobs' sister told The Associated Press on Sunday that the family knew about the video that purported to show the slaying, but she would not comment.
        
        Staff Writers Scott Fallon and Elise Young contributed to this article, which also contains material from The Associated Press.

    textlede: Abduction may signal new tactic

        DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia
        
        With the kidnapping of an American and threats to inflict on him the same degrading punishments seen at Iraq's U.S.-run Abu Ghraib prison, suspected al-Qaida terrorists appear to have unleashed a new tactic in their violent drive against Saudi Arabia's rulers.
        
        Saudi authorities searched Sunday for Paul M. Johnson, an American who was apparently abducted by militants who also claimed responsibility for gunning down another American in Riyadh, the day before.
        
        It was the third killing of a Westerner in the Saudi capital in a week, part of an intensified campaign aimed at driving out foreigners and sabotaging the oil sector, key to the Saudi economy and basis of the rule by the kingdom's royal family.
        
        The three Americans killed or kidnapped by Islamic radicals in Saudi Arabia in the past week were likely selected as targets many days or weeks in advance and singled out because of their work as military contractors, the Washington Post reported, quoting unnamed U.S. and Saudi officials.
        
        Although Johnson is employed by Lockheed Martin, the telephone number on his business card indicates that he works at the Riyadh headquarters of Advanced Electronics Co., a Saudi technology firm that manages a number of defense contracts for the Saudi government.
        
        Advanced Electronics was the employer of Kenneth Scroggs, another American, who was gunned down by three assailants as he pulled into the garage of his Riyadh home Saturday afternoon, Saudi officials said.
        
        A third American, Robert Jacobs, was fatally shot in his Riyadh home on Tuesday after leaving the Riyadh office of Vinnell Corp., a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman Inc.
        
        Sunday, the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh warned Americans in the kingdom to pay close attention to their surroundings and to avoid predictable workday routines that could make them easy targets. The statement said last week's attacks on Americans "appear to have involved extensive planning and preparation and were likely preceded by extensive pre-attack surveillance."
        
        Al-Qaida, led by Saudi-born Osama bin Laden, often rails against Saudi Arabia's rulers for their close links to the United States.
        
        "The Saudis know that this is an enemy that is coming after them. The killing of foreigners is a direct attack against the Saudi regime," U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell said on ABC's This Week.
        
        Powell said Saudi leaders are mobilizing all resources against militants but added, "I think that there is more that they can do."
        
        The Saudis can "build up their forces" and cut off funding for militants, he said on Fox News Sunday.
        
        "There's probably more we can do with respect to intelligence exchange, and we are working at all of these," he said.
        
        None of the gunmen have been caught in last week's fatal shootings of the two Americans and, on June 6, Irish cameraman Simon Cumbers.
        
        The purported al-Qaida statement, posted late Saturday on an Islamic Web site, threatened to treat Johnson, the abducted American, as U.S. troops treated Iraqi prisoners - a reference to sexual and other abuses at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.
        
        It showed Johnson's passport and a Lockheed Martin business card bearing his name. His son, Paul Johnson III, said his father moved to the kingdom more than a decade ago to work for Lockheed Martin.
        
        The al-Qaida statement said Johnson is one of four experts in Saudi Arabia working on developing Apache attack helicopter systems.
        
        "Everybody knows that these helicopters are used by the Americans, their Zionist allies and the apostates to kill Muslims, terrorizing them and displacing them in Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq," said the statement. It said al-Qaida would release a videotape later with Johnson's confessions and its demands.
        
        A car belonging to Johnson was found Saturday near Imam University, security officials said. Saudi press reports said the car was booby-trapped and later caught fire. The university is about 12 miles from the neighborhood where Scroggs was shot.
        
        Terror experts have noted that the militants are using several tactics - including shootings and ambushes where the gunmen do not die - rather than limiting themselves to suicide bombings or swift attacks under the cover of darkness.
        
        The statement claiming Saturday's shooting and kidnapping was signed by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, the same group that claimed responsibility for a May 29-30 shooting rampage and hostage-taking in the eastern Saudi oil hub of Khobar that killed 22 people, most foreigners. Saudi security arrested one attacker in Khobar, but three others escaped.
        
        Meanwhile, several Islamic Web sites were carrying links to a videotape - also purportedly from al-Qaida - that claims to show Tuesday's killing of Jacobs.
        
        The video, less than two minutes long, does not show any faces. It begins with men running in a garage and a voice yelling in English, "No, no, please!" A shot is fired, and the body of what appears to be a Western man falls.

        DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia
        
        RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- Authorities searched Sunday for an American apparently abducted by al-Qaida-linked militants who claimed responsibility for gunning down another American in the Saudi capital, the third killing of a Westerner in a week.
        
        The kidnapping, the first of a Westerner in the kingdom, appeared to be a new tactic in a campaign of violence in the kingdom believed to be aimed at sabotaging the vital Saudi oil sector.
        
        A statement purporting to be from al-Qaida threatened to treat the abducted American as U.S. troops treated Iraqi prisoners, a reference to sexual and other abuses at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.
        
        Saudi security officials reported that the body of a man, possibly a Westerner, was found in the capital Sunday. But Riyadh's police chief later said no Westerner's body was discovered.
        
        U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell said Saudi officials are "mobilizing all of their resources" against the militants, but added, "I think that there is more that they can do."
        
        The Saudis can "build up their forces" and cut off funding for militants, he said on Fox News Sunday.
        
        "There's probably more we can do with respect to intelligence exchange, and we are working at all of these," he said.
        
        The al-Qaida statement, posted late Saturday on an Islamic Web site, showed a passport-size photo of a brown-haired man and a Lockheed Martin business card bearing the name Paul Johnson. The statement said he was born in 1955.
        
        Johnson's son, Paul Johnson, of Cocoa, Fla., told NBC News that his father moved to Saudi Arabia in 1983 to work for Lockheed Martin.
        
        "Get my dad home safely," he said, addressing the kidnappers.
        
        "He doesn't deserve this."
        
        Word of the kidnapping came hours after an American, identified by the U.S. Embassy as Kenneth Scroggs, was gunned down in the Saudi capital. Scroggs was shot in the back as he parked in the garage at his home. The al-Qaida statement also claimed responsibility for the shooting.
        
        "We know that one American was killed and one American kidnapped," Powell said.
        
        None of the gunmen have been caught in the fatal shooting June 6 of an Irish TV cameraman, Tuesday's slaying of an American contractor or Scrogg's slaying.
        
        Saudi security officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said authorities were searching for the assailants. Saudi forces, they said, stormed a suburban Riyadh house Sunday morning, arresting a man inside and confiscating a computer. It wasn't clear if he was linked to any of the past week's shootings.
        
        Many foreigners work among Saudis in the kingdom, mostly in the oil sector, banking and other high-level businesses.
        
        The British Embassy in Saudi Arabia announced Sunday it was authorizing the voluntary departure of non-essential staff and their families.
        
        British Airways also announced that its flight crews will no longer stay overnight in Saudi Arabia because of security problems. BA said it was eliminating its eight direct flights per week from London to Riyadh and Jeddah and re-routing them via Kuwait City. Staff would spend the night in Kuwait to avoid the journey from a Saudi airport to a hotel.
        
        Fresh crews would board aircraft in Kuwait for the short flight to Saudi Arabia, where they will stop briefly before returning to London on the carrier's direct flights from Riyadh and Jeddah.
        
        The United States has urged all its citizens to leave the kingdom.
        
        A car belonging to Johnson was found Saturday near Imam University, security officials said. Saudi press reports said the car was booby-trapped and later caught fire. The university is about 20 kilometres from the neighbourhood where Scroggs was shot.
        
        The purported al-Qaida statement said Johnson is one of four experts in Saudi Arabia working on developing Apache attack helicopter systems and that the American killed worked in the same industry.
        
        Meanwhile, several Islamic Web sites were carrying links to a videotape, also purportedly from al-Qaida, that claims to show Tuesday's killing of American Robert Jacobs.
        
        The pan-Arab television station Al-Jazeera aired parts of the tape Sunday, showing two men surprising Jacobs as he tried to park in front of his garage then showing Jacob writhing on the ground as an attacker fired from a hand gun.
        
        Jacobs, 62, of Murphysboro, Ill., worked for U.S. defence contractor Vinnell Corp.
        
        The video, less than two minutes long, begins with men running in a garage and a voice yelling in English, "No, no, please!"

        The statement and the videotape were attributed to al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. There was no way to verify their authenticity. The same group claimed responsibility for a shooting and hostage-taking spree in the eastern Saudi city of Khobar on May 29-30. That attack in the hub of the Saudi oil industry killed 22 people, mostly foreigners.

    textlede: Gunmen kill American in Saudi capital; 2nd apparently taken hostage; al-Qaida claims responsibility

    textoriginal: |
        RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- Suspected militants killed an American in the Saudi capital on Saturday, shooting him in the back as he parked in his home garage, and the U.S. Embassy said it was searching for an American who was missing.
        
        A purported al-Qaida statement posted on an Islamic Web site late Saturday claimed the terror group had killed one American and kidnapped another in Riyadh. It threatened to treat the captive as U.S. troops treated Iraqi prisoners.
        
        The slaying and apparent abduction were the latest attacks in a campaign of anti-Western violence in the kingdom, believed by many to be aimed at driving out foreigners as a way to sabotage the vital Saudi oil sector.
        
        The U.S. Embassy identified the dead man as Kenneth Scroggs -- the third Westerner slain in the kingdom in a week. It did not identify the missing American but said it was working with Saudi officials to find him.
        
        The al-Qaida statement showed a passport-size photo of a brown-haired man and a Lockheed Martin business card bearing the name Paul M. Johnson. It said he was born in 1955.
        
        The mobile phone listed on the card was switched off, and a call to a second phone number was picked up by a voicemail message by a deep-voiced man who identified himself as Paul Johnson.
        
        The statement said the terror group would deal with Johnson just as "the Americans dealt with our brothers in Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib" -- a reference to sexual and other alleged abuses of Iraqi and Muslim prisoners by U.S. troops.
        
        The statement also said Johnson is one of four experts in Saudi Arabia working on developing Apache helicopter systems and that the American killed worked in the same industry. It did not identify the slain American but said he was killed at his house.
        
        "Everybody knows that these helicopters are used by the Americans, their Zionist allies and the apostates to kill Muslims, terrorizing them and displacing them in Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq," said the statement.
        
        It said al-Qaida would release a videotape later to show Johnson's confessions and list its demands.
        
        A Saudi security source told The Associated Press that Scroggs worked for Advanced Electronics Co., a Saudi firm whose Web site lists Lockheed Martin among its customers. The office number on Johnson's business card was for Advanced Electronics.
        
        In Scroggs' neighborhood, the Malaz district of Riyadh, witnesses told AP that three militants first shot him in the back as he pulled his car into the garage. The militants then moved closer and fired more shots.
        
        The statement was signed by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, the same group that claimed responsibility for a shooting and hostage-taking spree in the eastern Saudi city of Khobar on May 29-30. The attack at the hub of the Saudi oil industry killed 22 people, mostly foreign workers.
        
        An estimated 8.8 million foreigners work among 17 million Saudis in the kingdom, mostly in the oil sector, banking and other high-level businesses.
        
        Militant attacks against Westerners, government targets and economic interests in the Saudi kingdom have surged in the past two months, despite a high-profile campaign against terrorists the government began after suicide bombings last year.
        
        Crown Prince Abdullah, shown on Saudi television Saturday greeting visitors at a Riyadh palace, urged his guests to "inform me personally of anyone who has deviated from religion, attacked [it] or is an extremist."
        
        "I pledge, God willing, ... that they [militants] will not slip away from the hand of justice," Abdullah said.
        
        U.S. Ambassador James C. Oberwetter, in a statement reacting to Saturday's killing and other recent terrorist attacks, expressed his condolences to victims' families.
        
        "Those Americans who choose to remain here should exercise the utmost caution as they go about their daily life," Oberwetter said.
        
        "I applaud Saudi Arabia's determination to bring an end to terrorism in the kingdom," he added.
        
        Speaking in London, Sheik Saleh bin Abdulaziz Al Sheik, the Saudi minister for Islamic affairs, said Saturday that despite the recent surge of attacks, terrorism in his country had not reached crisis proportions.
        
        "If you look back through the efforts of the Saudi government in tackling terrorism, they have destroyed half of the terrorist force," Al Sheik told journalists at the Saudi embassy in London.
        
        "Our assessment of the situation is that it is controllable, but because there are sleeping cells and because the terrorists live in a crowded area the Saudi forces do not want to hurt any of the local people," he said.
        
        Terror experts have noted that the militants are using several tactics -- including shootings and ambushes where the gunmen do not die -- rather than limiting themselves to suicide bombings or swift attacks under the cover of darkness.
        
        They are also trying to avoid killing Muslims. The death of several Muslims and Arabs in a November compound attack in Riyadh horrified many Muslims -- something that could seriously affect recruiting efforts.
        
        Experts say the terrorists want to create "a psychosis of terror" so foreigners will leave the country, the oil and defense sectors would suffer and the system would weaken.
        
        On Tuesday, an American who worked for a U.S. defense contractor was shot and killed. Last Sunday, an Irish cameraman was killed and a British TV correspondent was critically wounded when fired on while filming in a neighborhood that is home to many Islamic militants.
        
        The United States has urged all its citizens to leave the kingdom, and the British Foreign Office has advised Britons against all nonessential travel to Saudi Arabia.

    textlede: AL-QAIDA THREATENS TO RETALIATE WITH PRISONER GROUP CLAIMS IT KILLED ONE AMERICAN AND HOLDS SECOND CAPTIVE

        RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- A purported al-Qaida statement Saturday claimed the terror group had kidnapped one American man in the Saudi capital and killed another American. It threatened to treat the captive as U.S. troops treated Iraqi prisoners.
        
        The U.S. Embassy confirmed an American was missing but would not identify him.
        
        "We do have reports of a missing American," an embassy spokesperson said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
        
        "We are working with local authorities to find him and are in touch with his family."
        
        The al-Qaida statement, posted late Saturday on an Islamic Web site, showed a passport-size photo of a brown-haired man and a business card bearing the name Paul M. Johnson. It said he was born in 1955.
        
        The statement said the terror group would deal with the hostage just as "the Americans dealt with our brothers in Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib" -- a reference to sexual and other alleged abuses of Iraqi and Muslim prisoners by U.S. troops.
        
        Earlier Saturday, an American identified by the U.S. Embassy as Kenneth Scroggs was shot and killed as he pulled his car into the garage of his Riyadh home.
        
        The statement claimed al-Qaida had killed an American at his house but did not identify him.
        
        The statement said Johnson is one of four experts in Saudi Arabia working on developing Apache helicopter systems and that the American killed worked in the same industry.
        
        "Everybody knows that these helicopters are used by the Americans, their Zionist allies and the apostates to kill Muslims, terrorizing them and displacing them in Palestine, Afghanistan, and Iraq," the statement said.
        
        "The mujaheddin also managed to kill another American who is working as a manager in the same military sector where the hostage was working. The mujaheddin monitored him and killed him in his house."
        
        The statement was signed by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, the same group that claimed responsibility for a shooting and hostage-taking spree in the eastern Saudi city of Khobar on May 29-30, killing 22 people.
        
        It said it would release a videotape later to list its demands and show Johnson's confessions.
        
        The statement could not immediately be verified. Al-Qaida leaders have threatened to strike at Western airlines and oil facilities in an attempt to drive more 5 million expatriates, including nearly 30,000 Americans, from Saudi Arabia.
        
        Several Islamic Web sites Saturday carried links to another videotape -- also purportedly from al-Qaida -- that claims to show the Tuesday slaying of American Robert Jacobs.
