    textoriginal: |
        Yemen is the Afghanistan of the Arab world. It is the poorest Arab country, its government is weak, its people are armed, it already faces a serious rebellion, it is strongly tribal and its mountain ranges are a natural refuge for groups like al-Qaeda.
        
        There is nothing new about the growing political, social and economic crisis in Yemen, but the world is waking up to it only since the attempt to blow up a Detroit-bound plane has been linked to al-Qaeda in Yemen. Now the regional wing of the group has claimed responsibility for training and arming Nigerian student Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab with the Christmas Day bomb.
        
        Yemen has been becoming increasingly unstable over the past two decades, ever since Saudi Arabia expelled a million Yemeni workers because Yemen refused to support the US-led war to expel Saddam Hussein's army from Kuwait in 1990.
        
        Osama bin Laden's family comes, in part, from Yemen. Yemenis played a role in the formation of al-Qaeda. A significant number of the suicide bombers in Iraq come from there. It has been a convenient bolt-hole for Saudi militants under pressure at home to escape to.
        
        The would-be Christmas Day bomber's personal connection to Yemen will be probed over coming days. But it is clear that al-Qaeda in Yemen has become stronger and is operating in a sympathetic environment in a country in which the mass of the population strongly opposes the US invasion of Iraq and intervention in Afghanistan.
        
        There have long been signs of al- Qaeda activity. The most spectacular was in 2000, when a boat packed with explosives rammed the USS Cole in Aden port, blowing a hole in its side and killing 17 US sailors.
        
        For a time the government in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, appeared to have arranged an unspoken ceasefire with the local branch of al-Qaeda.
        
        But the invasion of Iraq by the US led to a more militant leadership taking over the group.
        
        They were reinforced in 2006 when 23 prisoners escaped from prison in Sanaa, reportedly with the aid of sympathetic Yemeni security officers. The escapees included Nasir al-Wuhayshi, a leader of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).
        
        Ever since, attacks have been increasing on foreign tourists, missionaries and oil installations. In September 2008 a car bomb outside the heavily fortified US embassy in Sanaa killed 16 people, including six well-armed attackers.
        
        In spring 2008, Saudi commanders of al-Qaeda told their militants to move to Yemen, and in January 2009 the Saudi and Yemeni wings merged.
        
        Saudi Arabia announced a list of its 85 most wanted militant suspects, of whom it said 26 were in Yemen.
        
        This is probably the overall membership of AQAP, whose small size makes it difficult to find and eliminate.
        
        Last August a suicide bomber almost killed the Saudi anti- terrorism chief, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef. Last month AQAP killed three senior Yemeni security officers, with their bodyguards, in south Yemen. The Yemeni security chief, Ali Mohammad al-Ansi, says 29 al- Qaeda members who had been planning to attack the British embassy and oil installations have been arrested.
        
        Washington has quietly been supplying military equipment, intelligence and training to Yemeni forces, who have raided suspected al- Qaeda hideouts. On Christmas Eve, Yemeni forces targeted a gathering of top militant leaders, possibly killing a radical cleric linked to the US Army major accused of the Fort Hood shooting in November.
        
        Joseph Lieberman, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, admitted yesterday that the growing US presence in Yemen includes Special Operations, Green Berets and intelligence. In 2009, the Pentagon provided Yemen with $US67 million ($A74.8 million) in overt counter-terrorism assistance; officials have proposed expanding that in 2010.
        
        Mr Lieberman, who recently visited Sanaa, said a US official there told him that "Iraq was yesterday's war. Afghanistan is today's war. If we don't act pre-emptively, Yemen will be tomorrow's war."
        
        The Yemeni Government will do what it can to show willingness to the US in pursuit of al-Qaeda. But the threat to its own existence comes from various directions: first, the civil war it is fighting with Shia revivalists whom it claims are backed by Iran in the northern province of Saada; then secessionism in the south sparked by discontent over the outcome of Yemeni unification in 1990 and the civil war that followed; and finally a growing economic crisis as Yemen's small oilfields, which provide revenue, are running out.
        
        Pressure from the US to pursue al- Qaeda will be one extra strain on a government which has been unable to cope with these multiple crises.

    textlede: US behind the scenes of Yemen terrorism fight; The US is stepping up its efforts in Yemen quietly, giving the country tools and money to comabt terrorism without fanfare. The strategy is the result of lessons learned in Pakistan, in particular.
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        For Americans focused on Afghan­istan and Pakistan as key in the fight against terrorism, the attacks late last year at Fort Hood, Texas, and in an airplane over Detroit were a wake-up call that a new front is quickly emerging in Yemen. The Nigerian who tried to blow up a jetliner as it landed in Detroit on Christmas Day claims to have received training in Yemen. And US officials found numerous links between alleged Fort Hood shooter Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan and a radical Yemeni cleric.
        
        The White House, however, is already ahead of the curve in addressing the security concerns there, some experts say. Without fanfare, the Obama administration has ramped up military aid and backed vigorous counterterrorist action. Indeed, the Yemeni branch of Al Qaeda said the Christmas attack was payback for two US-backed airstrikes. Yemen presents an opportunity for the United States to get right what it has tried with mixed results in Pakistan and Afghan­istan, experts say: take early action to help a faltering nation from becoming a haven for terrorists. America's experience in those countries is informing how it deals with Yemen - quietly and carefully so as not to be seen as using Yemen to do its dirty work. Yemen's unemployment at 40 percent The threats to Yemen's stability are mounting. Once a culturally rich country steeped in thousands of years of African and Arab influences, Yemen has become economically, socially, and politically impoverished. Its population of 22 million is expected to double within the next 20 years, and about 40 percent of the current population is unemployed. With the country's main resource, oil, expected to zero out within seven years, according to an energy index compiled by BP, the concern is that the growing number of young men will become disaffected and radicalized, according to a report by Richard Fontaine, an analyst at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank in Washington. This is the setting that Al Qaeda seeks to turn to its advantage. Al Qaeda in Yemen came to prominence in 2000 with the bombing of the USS Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden that killed 17 American sailors. Largely ignored since, Al Qaeda in Yemen now has about 1,000 operatives, say Yemeni officials. Recent years have seen the emergence of a group calling itself Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, thought to be headed by Nassir al-Wahishi, a former secretary to Osama bin Laden. Its failed attempt to use a suicide bomber to assassinate the head of counterterrorism of the Saudi royal family in August 2009, combined with the failure of the Christmas Day bombing of Northwest Flight 253, suggests an ineffective organization. Yet AQAP presents a nascent threat as it reaches to make an impact outside the region. Nearly half the detainees remaining in Guantánamo Bay are from Yemen. Some reports suggest Yemenis already released were behind the Christmas Day bombing attempt. For this reason, Obama will confront a problem in trying to close Guantánamo. pagebreak How the US is reaching out In response, the US has established a security program with Yemen that is small but has expanded significantly since last year. The Pentagon has given $70 million in military aid - training and equipment - in an attempt to get a foot in the door and strengthen goodwill. The US Coast Guard is also working to assist the Yemeni government in safeguarding a choke point in the Gulf of Aden that is in Western shipping interests. But the US must strike a balanced approach to Yemen, where experts warn it must navigate a complex political terrain and not be too heavy-handed. This is where the US can draw lessons from its relationship with Pakistan, say security and congressional experts. The US is keen on pushing Yemen to fight the Al Qaeda cell within its borders. But Al Qaeda is not the biggest threat to Yemeni stability. That is posed by the al-Houthi separatist movement in the north. The group's aims are not well articulated, but it appears to want to topple the Yemeni government or at least foment an unrest from which it can draw strength. The US has learned the hard way that if it does not focus on the internal dynamics of a country from which it wants favors, the results can be counterproductive. Pakistan is a case in point. As in Yemen, Pakistan's greatest threat does not come from Al Qaeda but from a domestic menace. The Pakistani Army is focused on the Pakistani Taliban. The US, however, wants Pakistan to confront the Afghan Taliban, who are based in Pakistan but attack US and allied forces in Afghanistan. Learning from mistakes in Pakistan Much of what the US learned in its terse relationship with Pakistan should be applied to Yemen in order to avoid the same mistakes, says one congressional staffer who traveled to Yemen this year and agreed to speak on background, as he was not officially authorized to speak on the topic.
        
        "A lot of those answers should inform what we do in Yemen," he says, adding that the US should focus on a long-term relationship that is not all about counterterrorism. Pakistanis have accused the US of only using Pakistan when it serves American interests. To avoid that perception in Yemen, President Ali Abdullah Saleh will seek "affirmation" from the US in a big way - financial aid and also trips to the White House and validation from wealthier neighbors like Saudi Arabia.
        
        "We need to create incentives for the Yemeni government to step up," the staffer says. The US may already be learning to tread more carefully. When the Pentagon publicized a US drone attack against Al Qaeda in November 2002, it inadvertently undermined the credibility of the Yemeni government. Last month, when the US assisted in a series of drone attacks against Al Qaeda, the US would not acknowledge its role, saying only that it "applauded" Yemeni efforts. --- See also: Al Qaeda haven?

    textlede: Jetliner Plot Demonstrates Growing Ability of Qaeda Affiliates to Stage Attacks
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        The plot to blow up a Northwest Airlines flight over American soil on Christmas Day represents an ominously new and lethal ability by a branch of Al Qaeda to attack the United States directly, according to government and independent counterterrorism specialists.
        
        Until now, American officials had expressed concern over the capability of Qaeda affiliates in North Africa, Yemen and Iraq, and a militant Islamist group in Somalia closely tied to Al Qaeda, to attack American and other Western targets in their regions. But they remained confident that these groups -- unlike Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda in Pakistan -- could not threaten the United States itself.
        
        That assessment has changed, as American intelligence officials say Qaeda operatives in Yemen trained and equipped a 23-year-old Nigerian man to evade airport security measures and ignite a powerful explosive on a commercial airliner. Four months ago, a suicide bomber from the same group, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, using a similar explosive, nearly killed a top Saudi counterterrorism minister.
        
        "Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has grown in confidence and seems to be developing a capability beyond the other Al Qaeda nodes," said Richard Barrett, a British former intelligence officer now monitoring Al Qaeda and the Taliban for the United Nations, who visited Yemen two weeks ago.
        
        Even as the United States pours 30,000 more troops into Afghanistan and increases pressure on Pakistan to eliminate Al Qaeda's top leaders and sanctuary in Pakistan's tribal areas, the thwarted attack on an Amsterdam-to-Detroit flight underscores how the Obama administration must now defend the United States from attacks conceived in multiple havens abroad.
        
        "This is the canary in the coal mine," said Juan Carlos Zarate, a top counterterrorism official under President George W. Bush.
        
        "Al Qaeda's regional satellites are seen as platforms for Al Qaeda's global agenda."
        
        Last month, federal officials unsealed terrorism-related charges against men they say were important actors in a recruitment effort that led roughly 20 young Americans to join the Shabab, a violent insurgent group in Somalia with ties to Al Qaeda. Law enforcement officials fear that the recruits, who hold American passports, could be tapped to return to the United States to carry out attacks here, though so far there is no evidence of such plots.
        
        Al Qaeda's affiliate in North Africa has carried out a string of killings, bombings and kidnappings against Westerners and African security forces in recent months that have raised fears that the Algerian-based group may be taking a deadlier turn.
        
        "We think of core Al Qaeda in Pakistan as a very potent group, but not huge," said Daniel L. Byman, a former intelligence analyst now at Georgetown University.
        
        "But if you add the affiliates that are actively targeting us, it becomes a much bigger number."
        
        Al Qaeda's ties with its affiliates play out at different levels. This year, American officials began seeing the first evidence that dozens of fighters from Pakistan, along with a handful of the terrorist group's midlevel leaders, were moving to Somalia and Yemen. The terrorist groups in all three locations are now communicating more frequently, and apparently are trying to coordinate their actions, the officials said.
        
        "Al Qaeda in the tribal areas -- Al Qaeda central -- gives strategic guidance to its regional affiliates," said an American counterterrorism official, who spoke anonymously because he was not authorized to discuss the group publicly.
        
        "It's not a hands-on, day-to-day, tactical relationship."
        
        To be sure, American and European counterterrorism experts say the ability and expertise of the Qaeda satellites are still limited. A report by Dutch counterterrorism specialists issued Wednesday, for example, concluded that the planning and preparation for the failed attack against the Northwest Airlines flight was "fairly professional, but its execution was amateurish."
        
        And the groups' effectiveness often hinges greatly on the personalities of their leaders. The death in 2006 of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, coincided with the decline of that group's influence in Iraq.
        
        By design as well as necessity, the plots hatched by Al Qaeda's regional affiliates are typically smaller and less spectacular than, say, Al Qaeda's failed plans to blow up several airliners over the Atlantic in 2006.
        
        But in setting their sights lower and relying on lone suicide bombers, rather than complicated plots with several confederates, these Qaeda affiliates may also pose a threat that is harder to thwart, as the Christmas Day incident demonstrated.
        
        The threat from Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- the combination of Yemeni and Saudi operatives announced in January -- has drawn increasing attention from American officials. The group has carried out several attacks against foreign embassies and Yemeni officials in the past two years, adding to security threats in Yemen that include an armed rebellion in the north and a secessionist movement in the south.
        
        As the United States and Yemen have increased their counterterrorism cooperation in recent months, the Qaeda affiliate sharpened its rhetorical attacks against the United States. In the latest issue of Sada al-Malahim, the Internet magazine of the Qaeda affiliate in Yemen, the group's leader, Nasser al-Wuhayshi, urged his followers to use small bombs "in airports in the Western crusade countries that participated in the war against Muslims; or on their planes, or in their residential complexes or their subways."
        
        A Qaeda operative in Yemen eulogized fellow militants killed in a Dec. 17 airstrike against an insurgent training camp in Abyan Province in southern Yemen.
        
        In a video recording of the speech several days after the strike, the speaker said his fight was not against Yemeni soldiers, only Americans: "We are carrying a bomb to hit the enemies of God. O soldiers, you should learn that we do not want to fight you, nor do we have an issue with you," according to a translation by IntelCenter, a terrorism research company.
        
        "We only have an issue with America and its agents. So, be careful not to side with America."
        
        In airstrikes facilitated by the United States this month, Yemeni officials said they had made targets of the leader, Mr. Wuhayshi, and his deputy, Said Ali al-Shihri, who were believed to be meeting with Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born radical cleric linked to the suspect in the November shooting at Fort Hood in Texas.
        
        Relatives of the cleric say he is still alive, and senior American officials said Wednesday that they were still trying to determine which, if any, of the top Yemeni militant leaders were killed or wounded in that attack.

    textlede: Yemen perfect haven for al-Qaida
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Yemen, a nearly failed nation, once more is a security concern for America as a result of a Christmas Day attempt to blast a U.S. airliner from the sky.
        
        Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, based in Yemen, claimed responsibility for the abortive attack. And Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian who tried to ignite an explosive on a Northwest Airlines flight landing in Detroit, went there twice, including once this month.
        
        Experts have long warned that Yemen could become even more of terrorist breeding ground than it has been since 2000, when al-Qaida operatives there attacked the USS Cole, a Navy destroyer, killing 17 sailors.
        
        Yemen's connection to the Christmas Day plot is no surprise, said Steve Emerson, executive director of the Investigative Project on Terrorism in Washington.
        
        He said the country "is emerging as a center of military and religious gravity in the jihadi war against the United States" -- and that "the jihadists perceive the United States as weak ... a paper tiger, in the same way we were perceived before 9/11."
        
        Al-Qaida in Yemen's claim of responsibility rings true, according to Evan Kohlmann, an analyst with the NEFA Foundation, a terrorism-monitoring group.
        
        He said al-Qaida factions in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Yemen are known to be "developing devices ... to skirt airline security, and very specifically by using PETN," a high explosive, concealed in clothing, as in the latest attempt.
        
        "What happens if they leave the Arabian Peninsula? They did," Kohlmann said, referring to Abdulmutallab, "and we didn't see him coming."
        
        NEFA's director of strategic operations, David Draper, believes "the bombmakers are going back to the drawing-board and looking at what went wrong" on Christmas Day, to "try this again, unless we stop them."
        
        Instability abounds
        
        Yemen is a mountainous nation whose 23 million people own three times as many guns as people. Its weak central government is beset by Shia insurgents in the north, secessionists in the south and large tracts of tribal land beyond its control.
        
        The Arab world's poorest country, its unemployment exceeds 35 percent. The cornerstone of its economy, oil, is expected to run out in a few years; its water reserves are being drained to grow qat, a leafy stimulant chewed by most Yemenis.
        
        Such instability makes it a perfect haven for al-Qaida, experts say.
        
        No one knows how many al-Qaida members are there, but experts and Yemeni officials estimate between 200 and 300.
        
        Ninety percent of detainees returned to Yemen from U.S. custody at Guantanamo Bay have rejoined the jihadists, according to terrorist-tracker Emerson: "Those who do (go) back ... become 'rock stars' and the top officials of al-Qaida."
        
        A week before Christmas, the government of Yemen -- presumably with U.S. help -- launched raids and missile strikes on al-Qaida training camps and safe houses.
        
        Hani Abdu Musalih Al Shalan, a Guantanamo prisoner repatriated in 2006, reportedly died in the attacks.
        
        Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical Islamic cleric who was contacted by Fort Hood shooter Nidal Hassan, reportedly escaped.
        
        NEFA's Kohlmann describes the targets of the Yemeni-U.S. attacks as "not just Yemenis and Saudis, but Africans and Pakistanis as well.
        
        "Now, that sounds more like a Waziristan" -- Pakistan's notoriously lawless tribal region, suspected to be a haven for key Islamist terrorist leaders -- "or Somalia ... a place where you have an international core of volunteers who believe they can get training and expertise there."
        
        'Just part of the threat'
        
        "One of the problems for the United States is that, in recent years, it has tended to tie all of its aid ... (and) to see Yemen solely through the prism of al-Qaida," according to Gregory Johnsen, a Yemen expert at Princeton University.
        
        Yemeni officials, journalists and tribesmen have told him on recent trips "that they are worried that if the al-Qaida threat went away, Yemen would be forgotten."
        
        "The way the United States is going now with these military strikes," he said, "... could easily be counterproductive. By killing people they don't intend to, it will inflame public opinion and you will drive more people toward al-Qaida."
        
        He favors a "multifaceted approach ... that includes diplomacy and development."
        
        Terrorist-tracker Emerson believes the United States must be more aggressive.
        
        "We need better intelligence collection, which means approving covert operations, which also means things could get messy and could mean a larger military footprint, which the United States doesn't want to do.
        
        "You can't gain intelligence from satellites only."
        
        Johnsen counters that U.S. and Yemeni forces "essentially killed al-Qaida in Yemen between 2001 and 2003. So we have been down this road before ... if you don't really address some of the root problems, then you are just going to be fighting different versions of al-Qaida every few years."
        
        Yet Emerson warns that Yemen "is just part of ... the jihadist threat. You had Americans from northern Virginia going to Pakistan to fight against the U.S. You had 13 major terrorist plots in the U.S. this year, the highest number since 9/11.
        
        "We are the No. 1 object of the jihadist threat, so pretending it doesn't exist and not mentioning the nature of the threat will only embolden them."
        
        The Christmas Day plot, he says, "should obviously be a wake-up call."

    textlede: At Yemen school, portrait of a man who had changed; Abdulmutallab grew more religious, teachers and classmates say
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        The young Nigerian man had visited Yemen once before, in 2005. But by the time Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab returned this past August, again to study Arabic, he appeared to have become a very different person, more deeply religious, more of a loner, and forsaking Western clothing in favor of a long, white traditional Islamic tunic.
        
        Abdulmutallab also expressed an inner confidence and a certainty of purpose, according to former teachers, classmates and housemates. The 23-year-old seemed to be on a mission, spending long hours in a mosque, often missing classes, and even ordering a classmate to stop smoking in front of him.
        
        In more than a dozen interviews on Wednesday, those who know him shared impressions of the man who joined them for language school in Yemen this summer only to vanish in October and emerge on Christmas Day on a Detroit-bound flight from Amsterdam with chemical explosives allegedly sewn into his underwear.
        
        At a dinner in September, Abdulmutallab demanded that classmate Sigurd Sorensen walk behind him as he said his evening prayers.
        
        "What faith are you?" Abdulmutallab demanded.
        
        "Christian," Sorensen replied.
        
        "Islam is the only true way," Abdulmutallab then declared, according to Sorensen.
        
        "If you want to go to heaven, you should accept it."
        
        Teachers said Abdulmutallab now bears little resemblance to the man they remembered from four years earlier.
        
        "He was so open-minded in 2005. He spoke to everybody," said one of his instructors at the Sanaa Institute for the Arabic Language. The teacher spoke on the condition of anonymity because Yemeni security officials had ordered the school's staff members not to talk to journalists.
        
        "In 2009, he barely came to class. I wouldn't see him in a week."
        
        When Abdulmutallab spoke, he was courteous. He didn't publicly express radical thoughts, didn't lash out against U.S. policies in Iraq or Afghanistan. He didn't express core Muslim grievances such as Israel's treatment of Palestinians. He often handed out money to poor Yemenis and African migrants.
        
        "He was friendly. He always smiled. We didn't see an ounce of aggressive behavior," said Ahmed Mujaeb, a teacher.
        
        "I felt sad when I heard what he had done. I asked myself 'Why?' This is a big question mark."
        
        Yemeni investigators are trying to piece together what happened to Abdulmutallab between October and December, when he apparently left Yemen. He allegedly told U.S. authorities that he was equipped and trained by a bombmaker linked to al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which has asserted responsibility for the plot to bomb Northwest Flight 253.
        
        It has shined an unwanted spotlight on the institute, housed in a tan three-story mansion with a tree-speckled courtyard in the historic quarter of Sanaa. Since 2001, the institute has taught Arabic to hundreds of foreign students, including many Americans. It offers one religious course, a basic introduction to Islam to help students learn classical Arabic. Yet students and teachers said they feared the school would be unfairly tainted as a jihadist breeding center.
        
        Under the online name Farouk1986, Abdulmutallab wrote in a June 2005 posting that the school was "great."
        
        He gushed about Britons and Americans in the capital and about eating at Pizza Hut and KFC.
        
        When he returned this time, he was not seen eating fast food, said Ahmed Hassan, a classmate from Singapore who lived next door to Abdulmutallab in the school's residence building. Every morning, he woke up before dawn to pray. He ate breakfast in his room or alone in the cafeteria, his housemates said. He spoke Arabic well and had improved tremendously since 2005, when he was enrolled in a beginner's class, his instructors said.
        
        Abdulmutallab did not listen to music; the only sound his housemates heard from his room were his recitations of the Koran. One day, the call for prayer floated from a mosque into the classroom. Abdulmutallab stood up and informed the class that he must go and pray in the mosque, and left, Hassan recalled.
        
        In September, during the last 10 days of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, his teachers said, Abdulmutallab performed itikaf, a spiritual retreat during which devout Muslims spend evenings and nights in a mosque, worshiping and reading the Koran.
        
        The few instances when he had conversations with classmates, the discussion inevitably turned to religion.
        
        "He believed in the infallibility of the Koran," said Matthew Salmon, a Canadian student.
        
        Abdulmutallab spoke English with a West African clip and frequently mixed his conversations with Koranic terms. He didn't discuss his family or personal matters, Hassan said. Most students thought he was poor; they were surprised to learn recently that his family is wealthy.
        
        His room was spare; when he was inside, he often locked the door. One day, Hassan managed to peek inside, he said. There were no photos of Abdulmutallab's family. The only item on his desk was a laptop. The walls were bare.
        
        By the end of September, Abdulmutallab seemed intent on learning Islamic sharia law. He told Hassan and other classmates that he wanted to attend an Islamic school in Hadhramaut, a southern province where al-Qaeda has deep roots. He told other classmates that he wanted to be an engineer.
        
        One night in late September, Salmon said, he asked Abdulmutallab how long he was planning to stay at the school. He told Salmon that he would stay another month or two, and then return to London, where he attended college.
        
        The next day, Abdulmutallab disappeared.
        
        "He didn't even say goodbye to us," Hassan said.
        
        Questions and anger now swirl around the school. Some classmates wonder whether his decision to return to the school was merely a pretext, a way to gain entry to Yemen to conduct a terrorist act. Others made it a point to show a visiting journalist one of the school's textbooks -- to prove there were no references to jihad or terrorism.
        
        "My roommates and I are very frustrated," Salmon said.
        
        "This damages the credibility of the school, of Yemen, and of Islam itself."

        Micah Zenko: A military strike on Yemen in response to the attempted attack on flight 253 would be a bad short-term solution, as history shows
        
        FULL TEXT
        
        American officials are still unravelling the on Christmas Day by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab. While details remain unclear, it appears that Abdulmutallab received operational guidance and training in Yemen from .
        
        The revelation of the Yemeni-based group's involvement has predictably brought pressure from congressional leaders and policy analysts to "do something" in response, including what is described by one administration official as "".
        
        An overt and immediate US military strike in Yemen in response to the failed bomb plot , but it would be a bad short-term solution. As recent history demonstrates, counterterrorist strikes in retaliation for specific terrorist plots or operations have often proven to be militarily ineffective, and unsuccessful in deterring the targeted group from pursuing additional terrorist attacks. Consider three well-known examples:
        
        · In April 1986, the US president for its involvement in the bombing of a Berlin disco that killed two American servicemen. US aircraft bombed a range of targets associated with the regime of Muammar Gaddafi, including the Aziziyah Barracks compound in Tripoli, where it was believed the Libyan leader lived.
        
        The results of the attacks were meagre: Libya's infrastructure was not significantly damaged and Gaddafi survived, becoming more defiant than ever. Moreover, Libya's support for international terrorism increased in direct response, with British and American hostages in Lebanon assassinated by Libyan-controlled terrorist groups, and most significantly, the , Scotland, which killed 270 people.
        
        · In June 1993, after Iraqi intelligence agents allegedly plotted an on the former US president George HW Bush during a trip to Kuwait, President Clinton ordered the launching of 23 cruise missiles against one wing of the Iraqi intelligence agency headquarters in Baghdad.
        
        The results of this retaliatory strike were a success, though it remains unclear if the cruise missiles played any role. The leadership wing of the Iraqi intelligence headquarters was destroyed, and according to , counterterrorism tsar to presidents Clinton and Bush: "Subsequent to that June 1993 retaliation, the US intelligence and law enforcement communities never developed any evidence of further Iraqi support for terrorism directed against Americans."
        
        · In August 1998, in retaliation for the bombing of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, the US launched 13 Tomahawk cruise missiles against a pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum, Sudan, suspected of producing nerve gas, and 60-70 Tomahawks against three al-Qaida training camps in southern Afghanistan with the intention of killing Osama Bin Laden and other terrorist leaders.
        
        While the pharmaceutical plant was destroyed during , the evidence supporting its connections to either al-Qaida or nerve gas production quickly evaporated. In addition, the attacks against the al-Qaida leadership killed a few dozen people, including Pakistani intelligence officers training militants to fight in Kashmir. Bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, Mohammed Atta - ringleader of the 9/11 attacks - and other key al-Qaida leaders survived, and were certainly not deterred.
        
        These examples show that a more prudent immediate response to terrorist plots or operations is to understand why the existing counterterrorism plans and programmes failed, and how they should be adjusted and enhanced. While military force is undoubtedly an essential tool against individuals directly responsible for terrorist plots and operations, responding too quickly allows US adversaries to dictate the terms of US policy, and elevates and emboldens them in the eyes of the world.
        
        In October 2000, the while refuelling in Aden, Yemen, killing 17 sailors and wounding 39 others. Four months later, the intelligence community provided conclusive evidence to the Bush White House of al-Qaida's direct involvement. Twenty-one months after that, after significantly increasing US counterterrorism co-operation with Yemen and methodically developing sources within the country, in November 2002, a CIA-controlled Predator drone , the al-Qaida operative responsible with overseeing the Cole bombing.
        
        In this instance, military retaliation succeeded. But as the Northwest Airlines plot demonstrates, without a long-term and comprehensive programme to enhance Yemeni security and governance capacity, there is little that the US can do to prevent terrorists from operating there.

    textlede: Use of Muslim militancy to defeat Arab nationalism a massive strategic error
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Young Muslims are easy recruits for liberation groups such as al-Qaeda, the Taliban or Hamas, writes Michael Jansen
        
        AL-QAEDA IN the Arabian Peninsula has issued a chilling communique, couched in a medieval idiom, following its failed attempt to destroy a US airliner over Detroit on Christmas Day.
        
        The organisation, dubbed Aqap, claimed responsibility, praised its agent, Omar Farouk Abdul Muttalab, a 23-year-old Nigerian, and boasted of its prowess with high-powered explosives.
        
        Dismissing the failure of the Detroit device as God s will , Aqap pledged: We will continue on the path (God willing) until we achieve what we want \.\.\. We call upon all Muslims \.\.\. to kill every Crusader in the Arabian Peninsula, and to punish US citizens for supporting leaders who kill our women and children \.\.\. We have come to slaughter you and have prepared for you men who love death just as much as you love life.
        
        It is now nearly 70 years since the US initiated tentative contacts with the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, the mother-and-father of all militant Muslim groups.
        
        The brotherhood, founded in 1928 as a revivalist, social reform and anti-imperialist movement, has inspired and indoctrinated thousands of young Muslims who studied at universities in Egypt, once the cultural capital of the Arab world.
        
        Affiliates of the Egyptian brotherhood formed organisations in Palestine, Syria, Iraq, Kuwait and Jordan, and have served as mentors for militant organisations rising in the wider Muslim world.
        
        Following the 1952 ouster of Egypt s king by Gamal Abdel Nasser, Washington courted the brotherhood in an effort to counter the tide of secular Arab nationalism engulfing the Arab world from Algiers in the west to Aden in the east.
        
        Saudi Arabia was also encouraged to use a portion of its oil revenues to promote Muslim activism as a counterweight to the drive for liberation of Arab countries and the unification of the Arab front. These were seen as threats to western interests in the region and to Israel, established by war in 1948 at the expense of Palestinian Arabs.
        
        At first, Washington and its western allies ignored the fact that the brotherhood s agenda included liberation, as well as calling on Muslims to return to their faith and abide by traditional social norms.
        
        However, the West exploited the liberation aspect of the brotherhood programme in 1979 when the Soviet Union invaded strategic Afghanistan. The US and Saudi Arabia conspired to oust the Soviet Union from the country by co-opting the native Afghan resistance and bolstering it with holy warriors from the Muslim world.
        
        Arab, Asian, African and European veterans of this campaign have since formed the core of local militant groups as well as al-Qaeda and its franchises in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Yemen, Somalia, Pakistan and Afghanistan.
        
        After Shia clerics toppled the shah of Iran in 1979, oil-rich Saudi Arabia, aided and abetted by the West, strove to counter Iran s efforts to export its Shia Islamic Revolution. Sunni competitor Saudi Arabia projected its puritan religious ideology by building mosques and training preachers.
        
        The Saudi aim was to convert congregations in the 85 per cent Sunni majority worldwide community, the Umma, to Riyadh s uncompromising Wahhabism.
        
        However, a significant minority of converts adopted the liberation struggle as well as personal piety, and returned to traditional Muslim behaviour and practice.
        
        Angry and frustrated by Israeli policies in the occupied Palestinian territories, US wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and the impotence of their US-allied rulers, young Muslims became easy recruits for liberation groups, whether al-Qaeda, the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban, or Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
        
        The conclusion that must be drawn from this experience is that the use of Muslim militancy to defeat Arab nationalism was a monumental strategic mistake.
        
        The conflict between militant Muslims and the West is civilisational, with historical, religious, cultural, and nationalist dimensions, and is, consequently, nearly impossible to resolve.
        
        The dispute between the Arab nationalists and the West was merely political, and might have been resolved if the western powers had addressed Arab grievances.

        Pakistan, Dec. 30 -- An attempted Christmas Day bombing of a US passenger jet has put a spotlight on the Middle East state of Yemen which American spy agencies see as a rapidly growing hub for Al Qaeda.Civil war and lawlessness have turned the Arab world's poorest state into an attractive alternative base for Al Qaeda, which US officials say has been largely pushed out of Afghanistan and is under growing military pressure from the Pakistani army in bordering tribal areas.Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, 23, is charged with attempting to blow up a Northwest Airlines plane as it approached Detroit on a flight from Amsterdam with almost 300 people on board.In US questioning, Abdulmutallab claimed that Al Qaeda operatives in Yemen supplied him with an explosive device and trained him on how to detonate it, an official said.Al Qaeda's presence in Yemen has grown over the last year and Washington fears it could become a central base of operations outside Pakistan and Afghanistan, according to US counterterrorism officials and experts.The United States has quietly been supplying military equipment, intelligence and training to Yemeni forces, who have raided suspected Al Qaeda hide-outs this month, they said.US officials declined to discuss specific assistance but in September, US President Barack Obama sent a letter to Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh promising to help the government fight against terrorism, according to the national Yemeni state news agency Saba.Senator Joseph Lieberman, the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, said on 'Fox News Sunday' that the United States had a "growing presence" in Yemen, which included Special Operations, Green Berets and intelligence officers.Lieberman, who recently visited Sanaa, the capital of Yemen, said a US government official there told him that "Iraq was yesterday's war.
        
        Afghanistan is today's war. If we don't act preemptively, Yemen will be tomorrow's war".In recent congressional testimony, Mike Leiter, the director of the National Counter Terrorism Centre, called Yemen "a key battleground and potential regional base of operations from which Al Qaeda can plan attacks, train recruits, and facilitate the movement of operatives"."Of particular concern to the FBI are individuals who can travel with fewer restrictions to these areas of extremist activity and then enter the United States under less scrutiny," FBI Director Robert Mueller told lawmakers.Yemen has been a long-standing base of support for Al Qaeda. Militants bombed the Navy warship USS Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden in 2000, killing 17 US sailors, and Yemenis were one of the largest groups to train in Al Qaeda's camps in Afghanistan before September 11, 2001 attacks.Of the 198 prisoners left at the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, which Obama has vowed to close, 91 are from Yemen, and talks over repatriating them have bogged down due to concerns they will join Al Qaeda once they return.Since Saudi and Yemeni militants united earlier this year under the name 'Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula' with Yemen as their base, there has been a "steady uptick" in the group's activities, said Christopher Boucek, an expert with the Carnegie Endowment in Washington."Yemen has rapidly become a very important secondary front" in Al Qaeda's global ambitions, Boucek said, with the "greatest growth potential" because the government has been unable to exert control over its own territory.Besides combating Al Qaeda militants, Yemen is fighting Shia rebels in the north and faces separatist sentiment in the south.Fearing instability in Yemen could turn into a security threat for the kingdom, Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, began attacking Yemen's Shia Muslim rebels, known as the Houthis, at the beginning of November after the rebels staged a cross-border incursion and killed two Saudi borderguards.

    textlede: Key security agencies lack permanent leaders
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two federal agencies charged with keeping potential terrorists off airplanes and out of the country have been without their top leaders for nearly a year.
        
        It took the Obama administration more than eight months to nominate anyone to lead the Transportation Security Administration and the Customs and Border Protection agency.
        
        The attempted Christmas Day terrorist attack on a Detroit-bound airliner has prompted a review of U.S. security policies. The acting heads of those agencies -- both created in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks -- will be at the forefront of these discussions.
        
        Bogged down with health care reform, the Senate has yet to set a date to hold hearings for the Customs position. And Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., has placed a hold on the president's choice to head the TSA over the senator's concern that the new leader would let TSA screeners join a labor union. This has some Democrats blaming politics for the vacancy.
        
        Former U.S. attorney Alan Bersin is nominated to run CBP, and former FBI agent and police detective Erroll Southers is the president's pick for TSA. The current acting commissioner at CBP is planning to retire next month.
        
        On Christmas Day, alleged terrorist Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a Nigerian who spent time in Yemen, was able to sneak an explosive device aboard his flight from Amsterdam to Detroit, only to be thwarted by the device's apparent failure to work as designed, and aggressive action by other passengers.
        
        Abdulmutallab was not on the government's terrorist watch list -- though he was on a less sensitive and broader database. He was able to maintain a valid U.S. visa despite warnings about him to U.S. embassy officials in Nigeria from his father. Those facts are prompting a broad review of the government's terrorist detection efforts.
        
        "The president is looking for answers on this," Denis McDonough, chief of staff of the White House National Security Council, told reporters Monday in Hawaii, where President Barack Obama is vacationing. McDonough said officials have begun to assemble information related to watch list procedures. As yet, no one has been named to oversee the watch list review, he said.
        
        McDonough defended the current leadership and downplayed the significance of not having the new TSA administrator confirmed, although he said "the president is eager to have his TSA head on the job."
        
        Acting TSA Administrator Gale Rossides is "very able" and "we have a very able team of career professionals at TSA. We have a very able team in the Department at Homeland Security, generally," McDonough insisted.
        
        Some Republicans were more critical.
        
        "Running a security agency with a revolving door is a recipe for failure," said Rep. John Mica, R-Fla.
        
        Michael Chertoff, who headed the Homeland Security Department in the Bush administration, said if the country is going to work on enhancing security, there needs to be permanent people in place at TSA and Customs and Border Protection.
        
        "A year is too long a time," he said.
        
        Abdulmutallab, charged with trying to destroy an aircraft, is being held at the federal prison in Milan, Mich. A court hearing that had been scheduled for Monday to determine whether the government can get DNA from him was postponed until Jan. 8. No reason was given.
        
        U.S. officials had warning signs that Abdulmutallab might be a threat.
        
        The embassy visit in which Abdulmatallab's father said he was concerned about his son's radicalization triggered a Nov. 20 State Department cable from Nigeria to all U.S. diplomatic missions and department headquarters in Washington. It was also shared with the interagency National Counter Terrorism Center, said State Department spokesman Ian Kelly.
        
        These concerns landed Abdulmutallab among the about 550,000 names in the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment database, known as TIDE, which is maintained by the NCTC. Other, smaller lists trigger additional airport screening or other restrictions, but intelligence officials said there wasn't enough information to move Abdulmutallab into those categories.
        
        The NCTC, which has responsibility if any visas are to be pulled over terrorism concerns, then reviewed the information and found it was "insufficient to determine whether his visa should be revoked," Kelly said.
        
        According to Yemen's foreign minister, Abdulmutallab was in Yemen from August until early December. He had received a visa to study Arabic in a school in San'a, the Yemeni capital. Citing immigration authorities, the statement said Abdulmutallab had previously studied at the school, indicating it was not his first trip to Yemen.
        
        Yemen, the ancestral home of Osama bin Laden's family, has been an al-Qaida haven partly because of a weak central government and rugged terrain, affording al-Qaida fighters numerous places to hide. A Yemen-based group, Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, has claimed responsibility for Abdulmutallab's actions.

    textlede: Front: Terror plot: Country that is tearing itself apart is fertile territory for extremism: Why the west is worried: al-Qaida is able to exploit tribal tensions in Yemen - just as it does in Afghanistan and Pakistan
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        In the dusky-pink desert east of Sana'a, rows of mud-brick columns rise from the sand marking the temple, Arabs say, that was home to the Queen of Sheba, built to please the gods and bring her people prosperity in their trade of frankincense and myrrh.
        
        Once the jewel in the crown of Yemen's fledgling tourism industry, Marib today is an operational stronghold for al-Qaida, a place where tourists are killed in suicide bombings, security officers are kidnapped and killed in the name of religion and where young men are turned into jihadis. Men like Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the 23-year-old Nigerian who tried to detonate explosives aboard an American passenger jet over Detroit on Christmas Day.
        
        Yesterday, the investigation into the events that led up to the failed attack was focused increasingly on Yemen, amid growing fears that Abdulmuttallab might be just one of a string of would-be bombers to be trained in the country and heading to the west.
        
        "Many people here have lost their rights. Many are jobless. They meet foreigners who are connected to al-Qaida and become convinced to join them," said Sheikh Abdullah al-Shareef, a tribal leader from Marib explaining the rising number of young Yemenis from the area and beyond joining al-Qaida in Yemen. Abdulmutallab told US investigators that he was given the bomb and training by al-Qaida in Yemen. His father, banker Umaru Abdulmutallab, has said he thought his son travelled to Yemen before the attack, and a family friend told Reuters that Abdulmutallab had made two trips to Yemen for short Arabic and Islamic courses.
        
        In a recently released grainy internet video, Nasser al-Wahayshi, the serene-faced leader of Aqap, a merger between al-Qaida's Yemeni and Saudi branches, urged followers to attack countries involved in wars in Muslim lands as well as government figures and security bodies in the Middle East.
        
        "We will attack you from directions you can't imagine," boasted Wahayshi, surrounded by dozens of fighters in sandals and robes, many with their faces showing, displaying their collection of machine guns and rocket launchers, row after row of ammunition boxes and grenades which they claimed to have captured from Yemen's military.
        
        The threat comes amid growing concern that al-Qaida operatives are finding new ways to avoid detection. Abdulmutallab's bomb was sewn into the Nigerian student's underwear, near his testicles, to avoid detection by airport security. The tactic was similar to that used by another 23-year-old suicide bomber sent by al-Qaida in Yemen in August to assassinate Saudi's anti-terrorism chief, Prince Mohammed Bin Nayef.
        
        The bomber detonated explosives hidden inside his rectum during a meeting with the prince, who survived. It was the first attack on a royal family member since al-Qaida began attacks in the kingdom in 2003.
        
        "Hiding bombs inside the body to avoid security is a new tactic of al-Qaida in the Arabian peninsula," said Abdulelah Shaea, an expert on Islamist groups who earlier this year met with al-Qaida in Yemen.
        
        Wahayshi, a Yemeni, escaped from prison in Yemen in 2006 while his deputy, Saeed al-Shihri, a Saudi, was one of the first prisoners held by the US in Guantanamo, in 2002. Following his release into Saudi custody last year, Shihri escaped to Yemen to help establish al-Qaida there. The Wahayshi video bears the insignia Al Malahm - the final battle - and promises that al-Qaida in Yemen is gathering 12,000 jihadis to march on Jerusalem.
        
        In a country tearing itself apart, with civil war raging in the north and armed demonstrations calling for independence in the south, al-Qaida has found in the tribal strongholds of east Yemen a fertile ground to establish training camps and bases, realising the worst fears of western intelligence agencies.
        
        "If you look at the relationship between al-Qaida in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area and any group outside, the closest is with (al-Qaida) people in Yemen," Richard Barrett, a former senior British counter-terrorism official and now co-ordinator of the UN Taliban-al-Qaida sanctions monitoring committee, said last month.
        
        Mike Leiter, director of the US National Counter-terrorism Centre, recently warned Congress that Yemen was "a key battleground and potential regional base of operations from which al-Qaida can plan attacks, train recruits, and facilitate the movement of operatives". The FBI director, Robert Mueller, also warned before Abdulmutallab's bomb attempt: "Of particular concern to the FBI are individuals who can travel with fewer restrictions to these areas of extremist activity and then enter the United States under less scrutiny."
        
        Over the past two decades, Yemen has been a crossroads on the jihadi highway, supplying fighters to wars in Chechnya, Afghanistan, the Balkans and Iraq. During the CIA operation backing mujahideen fighters against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s, Yemen, alongside Saudi Arabia, was one of the countries supplying the most jihadis.
        
        Thousands then returned to Yemen, welcomed by the government who armed them to fight South Yemen's socialists in the 1994 civil war. Many former Afghan mujahideen remain loyal to powerful figures in Yemen's military. The new generation of al-Qaida in Yemen, however, is anything but.
        
        Earlier this month, al-Qaida claimed responsibility for the killing of a senior Yemeni security official, Bassem Tarboush, who had led the state's intelligence operations against al-Qaida in Marib. That followed a deadly ambush near the Saudi border which killed several senior Yemeni officers and was blamed on al-Qaida.
        
        Over the past year, hundreds of foreign, al-Qaida-linked fighters have spilled into Yemen from the chaos in neighbouring Somalia, just across the Red Sea, or have been driven into the country from Iraq and Afghanistan by the surge in US forces, according to US intelligence.
        
        The influx of violent extremists has come at a time when the country is growing more religiously conservative and impoverished. Half the population is illiterate and unemployment is over 35%.
        
        The five-year rebellion by the Huthis, a powerful Shia Muslim clan in the north, has stirred sectarian tensions with the majority Sunni population, many of whom now adhere to the Sunni fundamentalist doctrine of Wahhabism, imported from Saudi Arabia, of which al-Qaida's ideology is an offshoot.
        
        An Islamic school in Marib established by Abu al-Hassan al-Masri, an Egyptian, continues to teach Sunni fundamentalist doctrine to Yemeni and foreign extremists, according to local journalists with knowledge of the school.
        
        Meanwhile, President Ali Abdullah Saleh's regime risks a confrontation with powerful tribes which, in a tradition much like that in Afghanistan and Pakistan, have offered sanctuary to al-Qaida members, both out of loyalty to fellow Muslims and, say observers, for a cut in hugely lucrative weapon and drug smuggling that has flourished in areas like Marib over the past couple of years.
        
        "Al-Qaida touch on very sensitive issues in tribal areas. They come in the name of God and religion and talk about Palestine and the occupation of Iraq and people sympathise with them," said Brigadier Yehya Abdullah Saleh, commander of Yemen's anti-terror force.
        
        "We don't want to fight with the tribes so it is better to take out al-Qaida members one by one when they are separate from the tribes - or we risk a big war."

    textlede: U.S. turns quietly to Qaeda refuge; Yemen starting to rival Pakistan as a training and operational hub
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        The C.I.A. has sent counterterrorism agents to Yemen, and Special Operations commandos have begun training security forces there.
        
        FULL TEXT
        
        In the midst of two unfinished major wars, the United States has quietly opened a third, largely covert front against Al Qaeda in Yemen.
        
        A year ago, the Central Intelligence Agency sent some of its top field operatives with counterterrorism experience to the country, a former top agency official said. At the same time, some of the most secretive Special Operations commandos have begun training Yemeni security forces in counterterrorism tactics, senior military officers said.
        
        The Pentagon is spending more than $70 million over the next 18 months and using teams of Special Forces to train and equip Yemeni military, Interior Ministry and coast guard forces, more than doubling previous military aid levels.
        
        As U.S. investigators sought to corroborate the claims of a 23-year-old Nigerian man that Qaeda leaders in Yemen had trained and equipped him to blow up a Detroit-bound Northwest Airlines jet on Christmas Day, the plot cast a spotlight on the Obama administration's complicated relationship with Yemen.
        
        Yemen has long been a refuge for jihadists, in part because the government welcomed returning Islamist fighters who had fought in Afghanistan during the 1980s. The port of Aden was the site of a Qaeda attack on the U.S. destroyer Cole in October 2000, in which 17 sailors were killed.
        
        But Qaeda militants have made much more focused efforts to build a base in Yemen in recent years, drawing recruits from throughout the region and mounting more frequent attacks on foreign embassies and other targets. The White House is seeking to nurture enduring ties with the government of President Ali Abdullah Saleh and prod him to combat the local Qaeda affiliate, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, even as his impoverished country grapples with seemingly intractable internal turmoil.
        
        With fears also growing of a resurgent Islamist extremism in Somalia and East Africa, U.S. officials and lawmakers said Yemen could become Al Qaeda's next operational and training hub, rivaling the lawless tribal areas of Pakistan where the organization's top leaders operate.
        
        "Yemen now becomes one of the centers of that fight," said Joseph I. Lieberman, the independent U.S. senator from Connecticut who is the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee; he visited Yemen in August.
        
        "We have a growing presence there, and we have to, of Special Operations, Green Berets, intelligence," he said Sunday on a Fox News program.
        
        American and Yemeni officials said that a pivotal point in the relationship was reached in late summer after Gen. David H. Petraeus, the American regional commander, and John O. Brennan, President Barack Obama's counterterrorism adviser, made secret visits to Yemen.
        
        Mr. Saleh agreed to expanded overt and covert assistance in response to growing pressure from the United States and Yemen's neighbors, notably Saudi Arabia, from which many Qaeda operatives had fled to Yemen, the officials said. A rising threat against the country's political inner circle was also a factor, they added.
        
        "Yemen's security problems won't just stay in Yemen," said Christopher Boucek, who studies Yemen as an associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.
        
        "They're regional problems, and they affect Western interests."
        
        Al Qaeda's profile in Yemen rose sharply a year ago, when a former Guantánamo Bay prisoner from Saudi Arabia, Said Ali al-Shihri, fled to Yemen to join Al Qaeda and appeared in a video posted online. Several other former Guantánamo prisoners have also joined the group.
        
        Yemen's remote areas are notoriously lawless, but the chaos has worsened in the past two years as the government struggles with an armed rebellion in the northwest and a rising secessionist movement in the south. Yemen is running out of oil, and the government's dwindling finances have affected its ability to strike Al Qaeda.
        
        Meanwhile, there have been increasing Yemeni ties to plots against the United States. A Muslim man charged in the killing of a soldier at a recruiting center in a mall in Little Rock, Arkansas, on June 1 had traveled to Yemen, prompting a review by the F.B.I. of other domestic extremists who had visited the country.
        
        A radical cleric in Yemen, Anwar al-Awlaki, has been linked to numerous terrorism suspects, including Nidal Malik Hasan, the U.S. Army major who faces murder charges in the shooting deaths of 13 people at Fort Hood, Texas, in November.
        
        In the latest issue of Sada al-Malahim, the Internet magazine of the Qaeda affiliate in Yemen, the group's leader, Nasser al-Wuhayshi, praised the use of small bombs - not just big ones - to attack an enemy, an eerie foreshadowing of the Friday drama in Detroit.
        
        Yemen escalated its campaign against Al Qaeda with major airstrikes on Dec. 17 and last Thursday that killed more than 60 militants.
        
        American officials have been coy about the U.S. role in the strikes, saying they have provided intelligence and "firepower" for the efforts.
        
        The Yemeni foreign minister, Abu Bakr al-Qirbi, said Sunday that Yemeni military cooperation with the United States and Saudi Arabia had increased in recent months as fresh intelligence confirmed Al Qaeda's greater assertiveness in the country.
        
        "There was intelligence that they were targeting the British Embassy and a number of government institutions as well as private schools," Mr. Qirbi said in a telephone interview.
        
        "The second reason is that they have become more vocal, trying to show that they can undertake terrorist activities in an open fashion. So the government had to respond to that."
        
        The recent airstrikes were planned for two or three months, Mr. Qirbi said, but could not take place until there was fresh intelligence about the location of the Qaeda operatives who were the targets.
        
        He called that intelligence - which included information provided by the United States - "the most important element" in the successful strike on the Qaeda members.
        
        Mr. Qirbi added that although the United States provided Yemen with military hardware, the airstrikes were carried out by the Yemeni military alone.
        
        Although the most important intelligence came from the United States and Saudi Arabia, other countries in the region have increased their financial assistance in recent months to help Yemen, said Mustafa Alani, a security analyst at the Gulf Research Center in Dubai.
        
        "There was a fear inside and outside Yemen that Al Qaeda was taking new ground, establishing training centers, making some parts of Yemen no-go 00areas," Mr. Alani said. The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait in particular provided assistance, he said, because "they feel that sooner or later they will become targets, too."
        
        In the past year, Al Qaeda has killed six intelligence officers in the provinces where it is based, part of an unmistakable campaign by the group to secure its sanctuary there, Mr. Alani said. The intelligence officers were trying to gather information on the group, and to disrupt its growing links with local tribes - a significant part of its strategy, Mr. Alani added.
        
        The airstrikes of the past two weeks have been successful but have come at a price, Yemeni officials said.
        
        "They have been hit hard, but they have not yet been disabled," said one high-ranking Yemeni official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic issues involved.
        
        "The problem is that the involvement of the United States creates sympathy for Al Qaeda. The cooperation is necessary - but there is no doubt that it has an effect for the common man. He sympathizes with Al Qaeda."
        
        As if to reaffirm that message, Al Qaeda's Yemeni affiliate released a statement to Internet sites on Sunday that put strong emphasis on the U.S. role in the recent raids, deriding the Yemeni government for claiming responsibility.

        Al-Qaida Claims Airliner Attack
        
        1 Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula took credit for the attempted Christmas attack on a U.S. airliner, saying it was retaliation for a U.S. operation. In an online statement, the group said Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab coordinated with its members and used its explosives. Yemeni forces, helped by U.S. intelligence, carried out 2 airstrikes vs. al-Qaida this month, the 2 nd on Dec. 24.
        
        Gov't Admits: Security Failed
        
        2 Homeland Security Sec'y Janet Napolitano finally conceded that letting a Nigerian Muslim on a terror watch list to board a Christmas flight without a passport but with explosives was a security failure. Pres. Obama said the gov't is reviewing terror watch lists and screening procedures. The FAA lifted a post-Christmas ban on blankets and moving about the plane late in flights.
        
        Airline Shares Dip After Scare
        
        3 They fell after a Nigerian man tried to blow up a Northwest Airlines jet over Detroit on Christmas. Amid renewed terror fears -- and increased security-related travel hassles, American Air fell 5% and United 3%. Meantime, shares of bomb-detection equipment makers soared, with American Science and Engineering up 7%.
        
        Stocks' Win Streak Continues
        
        4 The major averages finished off their highs but extended their win streak to 6 sessions, helped by better holiday sales and rising commodity prices. The Dow rose 0.3%, the Nasdaq 0.2%. The NYSE composite and S&P 500 edged up 0.1% each. Volume climbed on both exchanges. Gold and oil prices rose. More on this page, A2
        
        Holiday Retail Sales Rose 3.6%
        
        5 The Nov. 1-Dec. 24 data followed a 2.3% drop in '08, said SpendingPulse, a unit of MasterCard Advisors.
        
        "We're talking about an environment that has stabilized," said SpendingPulse's Kamalesh Rao. Sales at electronics stores rose 5.9% and jewelry retailers 5.6%, but fell 0.4% at apparel chains. The S&P Retail Index edged up.
        
        Iran Gov't Detains Top Activists
        
        6 The body of the nephew of Iran's opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi -- slain in the deadliest day of anti-gov't protests in months -- disappeared from a hospital Mon., perhaps to prevent a funeral that could spur fresh protests. Security forces detained at least 7 notable activists, opposition reports said. State TV said 8 people died in Sun. violence amid heavy media curbs.
        
        Bomb Attack Kills 30 In Karachi
        
        7 A suicide bomber struck a procession marking a Shiite Muslim holy day in Pakistan's biggest city, killing 30 people and wounding 60. Officials blamed extremists trying to hamper the nation's fight vs. militants. Shiites responded by setting fire to buildings and cars at the blast site and pelting security forces with stones; the minority sect has suffered frequent attacks.
        
        Israel's Kadima Won't Join Gov't
        
        8 The centrist party headed by ex-Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni rejected PM Benjamin Netanyahu's offer to join a broad coalition. But some Kadima lawmakers could accept his offer. Also, Israel said it'll build 692 new apartments in east Jerusalem. Palestinians and the U.S. criticized the news. Israel had excluded east Jerusalem from a West Bank settlement construction slowdown.
        
        Afghan Attack Stirs Controversy
        
        9 Afghan Pres. Hamid Karzai said a weekend attack by Western forces killed 10 civilians in the remote northeast. He vowed a probe. Coalition forces said the dead were insurgents. Separately, U.S. deaths in Afghanistan in '09 has reportedly hit 310, twice the '08 toll. Also, NATO has warned that the Taliban have a shadow gov't in place.
        
        Soft Demand For 2-Yr Treasuries
        
        10 The Treasury sold $44 bil in 2-year notes at a yield above the pre-auction rate. Foreign and institutional investors showed particular reluctance. That may reflect the year-end lull but it bodes ill for the Treasury's other 2 big auctions this week. The 10-year yield rose 4 ticks to 3.84%, extending its run-up. The benchmark rate could hit 5.5% in '10, Morgan Stanley said.

    textlede: Al-Qaeda branch flourishing in Yemen
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Yemen, the poorest country in the Arab world, is fertile ground for radical movements, writes Michael Jansen
        
        AL-QAEDA IN the Arabian Peninsula (Aqap) has exploited Yemen's internal conflicts and general instability over the past two years to become the movement's most prominent franchise.
        
        Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian detained while allegedly trying to blow up a US civilian aircraft over Detroit on Christmas Day, claims to have been trained and equipped by this branch of the organisation.
        
        US army psychiatrist Nidal Hasan, accused of killing 13 US military personnel at Fort Hood in Texas on November 5th, had contact with Aqap-connected cleric Anwar al-Aulaqi while the latter served as a preacher in a Virginia mosque. In November, members of Yemen's al-Qaeda ambushed and killed three senior Yemeni security officials and their bodyguards. In August, a suicide bomber dispatched from Yemen tried to kill Saudi Prince Muhammad bin Nayef, head of the country's counter-terrorism operations.
        
        The incident on the Detroit- bound flight followed air raids on Aqap sites on December 17th and 24th that killed 60 people.
        
        US forces have been directly involved in the campaign against Aqap for more than a year and $70 million (EUR 49 million) has been allocated to arming and training Yemeni troops and coast- guard over the next 18 months.
        
        Yemen, the poorest country in the Arab world, is fertile ground for radical movements. The country's difficult terrain makes it hard to impose law and order. The 1990 union between the largely tribal Shia north and the Marxist south has not really taken off and Saudi puritan clerics have exported their views to Yemen's deeply conservative tribesmen.
        
        Al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden has a close connection with Yemen through his father, who was born and raised there before settling in Saudi Arabia, where he made a fortune in construction.
        
        Unlike many countries that contributed to the US-backed, Saudi-funded war against the Soviets in Afghanistan (1979 to 1989), Yemen welcomed home its battle-hardened and ideologically motivated fighters. For many, there were no jobs, so they drifted into criminal gangs that preyed on foreign workers and tourists.
        
        Politicised veterans created a Yemeni branch of al-Qaeda and in 2000, the group staged a dramatic bomb-laden speedboat attack in Aden harbour on a US warship, the USS Cole, killing 17 sailors.
        
        Under US pressure, the government cracked down on al-Qaeda, arresting many senior figures. In early 2006, however,
        
        23 were freed in a jail-break.
        
        In November 2008, al-Qaeda attacked the US embassy, killing 10 bystanders. A few weeks later, the Yemeni and Saudi branches merged to form Aqap.
        
        The movement's leader, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, is a scion of a wealthy Yemeni family, as well as an Afghan veteran and former personal assistant of bin Laden.
        
        The influential preacher Sheikh al-Aulaqi is the son of a former Yemeni minister of agriculture, while the father of the accused Detroit bomber is a leading banker in northern Nigeria.
        
        Aqap operatives come from upper and middle classes as well as poor backgrounds and from the ranks of released Guantánamo detainees.

    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        KAILUA, Hawaii -- A wing of al Qaeda claimed responsibility Monday for a failed Christmas Day attack on a U.S.-bound passenger plane and President Barack Obama vowed to bring "every element" of U.S. power against those who threaten Americans' safety.
        
        In a statement posted on Islamist websites, the group Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula said the attempt was to avenge U.S. attacks on its members in Yemen.
        
        The group said it had provided the Nigerian suspect in the failed airliner bombing with a "technically advanced device" but that it did not detonate because of a technical fault.
        
        Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, 23, is charged with smuggling explosives on board and attempting to blow up a Northwest Airlines flight as it approached Detroit from Amsterdam on Dec. 25 with almost 300 people on board.
        
        Speaking during a vacation in Hawaii, Obama said, "We will not rest until we find all who were involved and hold them accountable."
        
        "We will continue to use every element of our national power to disrupt, to dismantle and defeat the violent extremists who threaten us, whether they are from Afghanistan or Pakistan, Yemen or Somalia, or anywhere where they are plotting attacks against the U.S. homeland."
        
        Abdulmutallab, who had a valid U.S. visa issued before he was placed on a broad U.S. list of possible security threats, has told investigators that al Qaeda operatives in Yemen gave him an explosive device and taught him how to detonate it, officials said over the weekend.
        
        The incident has put a spotlight on the growing prominence of al Qaeda in Yemen, which the United States and Saudi Arabia fear will exploit instability in Yemen to stage attacks in the Saudi kingdom, the world's largest oil exporter, and beyond.
        
        The United States has quietly been supplying military equipment, intelligence and training to Yemeni forces, who have raided suspected al Qaeda hideouts this month, U.S. defence and counterterrorism officials said.
        
        In a worrying development for U.S. security, officials have discovered that Abdulmutallab's father warned them of his son's growing radicalism, but this information failed to prevent his traveling to the United States on a two-year visa issued June 16, 2008.
        
        Obama said that as a result of this oversight, he had ordered a thorough review of the screening process.
        
        "We need to determine just how the suspect was able to bring dangerous explosives aboard an aircraft and what additional steps we can take to thwart future attacks," Obama said.
        
        Obama is under pressure from opposition Republicans who have been critical of his response to the Christmas Day scare and have questioned whether his administration is doing enough to contain security threats.
        
        His administration admitted Monday that the incident represented a failure of air security.
        
        Asked on NBC's Today show if the security system "failed miserably," U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano replied, "It did."
        
        On Sunday, Napolitano said the system to protect air travel worked, but in appearances on news shows Monday she said she had meant that the response to alert other flights and airports and impose immediate new safety procedures had been effective.
        
        Abdulmutallab was overpowered by passengers and crew on the Northwest Airlines flight 253 after setting alight an explosive device attached to his body. He was treated for burns and is in federal prison awaiting trial.
        
        Airline stocks fell on Monday as the United States tightened airline security after the incident.
        
        AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, lost 4.8 per cent to $7.75. Shares of Delta, the parent of Northwest, were down 4.1 per cent to $11.29.
        
        The U.S. Transportation Security Administration did not give details of its new security measures. But air travellers described new restrictions on flights headed for the United States, including additional preflight screening, and --- an hour before landing --- a ban on movement around the cabin and on having items such as blankets on passengers' laps.
        
        The agency has since given pilots and flight crews discretion to ease these in-flight restrictions, a source familiar with the TSA rules said Monday.
        
        A TSA spokeswoman declined to confirm the change, saying the agency "will continuously review and update these measures to ensure the highest levels of security."
        
        Senate Homeland Security chairman Joe Lieberman, an independent who usually votes with Democrats, said he plans a January hearing to investigate the incident, including why Abdulmutallab was not checked against what the senator said was "our broadest list of suspected terrorists" and why body-imaging scanners are not used on more passengers.
        
        Dutch airport authorities said they planned to make new, more sensitive passenger scanners mandatory after Abdulmutallab allegedly smuggled explosives in his underwear through Schiphol Airport security.

    textlede: Al-Qaeda claims attack on plane
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Washington: Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula yesterday claimed responsibility for the attack on a US airliner bound for Detroit on Christmas Day, saying it was retaliation for a US operation against the group in Yemen.
        
        In an online statement, the group, an alliance of militants based in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, said Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab had co-ordinated with its members in the attack.
        
        It said Abdulmutallab used explosives manufactured by al-Qaeda members.
        
        "He managed to penetrate all devices and modern advanced technology and security checkpoints in international airports bravely without fear of death, relying on God and defying the large myth of American and international intelligence, and exposing how fragile they are, bringing their nose to the ground, and making them regret all what they spent on security technology," the group said.
        
        Yemeni forces, helped by US intelligence, carried out two air raids against al-Qaeda operatives in the country this month. The second one was a day before Abdulmutallab tried to bring down a Northwest Airlines flight as it prepared to land in Detroit.
        
        Abdulmutallab's claim that his bomb attempt originated with al-Qaeda's network inside Yemen had already deepened concern that instability in Yemen was providing the group with a base to train and recruit militants for operations against the West.
        
        It is the second known case recently of the relatively new al-Qaeda wing exporting terrorism out of Yemen, which has a weak central government, many lawless areas and plentiful supplies of weapons.
        
        In August it tried to assassinate Saudi Arabia's counter-terrorism chief, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, in a suicide bombing that bore similarities to the airliner plot.
        
        According to US court documents, preliminary analysis of the device used on Flight 253 showed it contained high-explosive PETN, believed to have been used in the August attack in Saudi Arabia by Abdullah Hassan Tali al-Asiri, who had travelled to Yemen to connect with the al-Qaeda group there.
        
        US Major Nidal Malik Hasan, who allegedly killed 13 people at the Fort Hood, Texas, army post, had exchanged dozens of e-mails with radical US cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was hiding in Yemen.
        
        Analysts say increased al-Qaeda activity in Yemen suggests it has strengthened and taken root in a country whose proximity to the world's top oil producer, Saudi Arabia, and vital maritime routes make it strategically more important than Afghanistan. - Sapa-AP

    textlede: Al-Qaida claims airplane attack; U.S. gov't admits security failure
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        A wing of al-Qaida claimed responsibility Monday for a failed Christmas Day attack on a U.S.-bound passenger plane and U.S. President Barack Obama vowed to bring "every element" of U.S. power against those who threaten Americans' safety.
        
        In a statement posted on Islamist websites, the group al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula said the attempt was to avenge U.S. attacks on its members in Yemen.
        
        The group said it had provided the Nigerian suspect in the failed airliner bombing with a "technically advanced device" but that it did not detonate because of a technical fault.
        
        Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, 23, is charged with smuggling explosives on board and attempting to blow up a Northwest Airlines flight as it approached Detroit from Amsterdam on Dec. 25 with almost 300 people on board.
        
        Speaking during a vacation in Hawaii, Obama said, "We will not rest until we find all who were involved and hold them accountable."
        
        "We will continue to use every element of our national power to disrupt, to dismantle and defeat the violent extremists who threaten us, whether they are from Afghanistan or Pakistan, Yemen or Somalia, or anywhere where they are plotting attacks against the U.S. homeland."
        
        Abdulmutallab, who had a valid U.S. visa issued before he was placed on a broad U.S. list of possible security threats, has told investigators that al-Qaida operatives in Yemen gave him an explosive device and taught him how to detonate it, officials said during the weekend.
        
        The incident has put a spotlight on the growing prominence of al-Qaida in Yemen. The United States and Saudi Arabia fear al-Qaida will exploit instability in Yemen to stage attacks in the Saudi kingdom, the world's largest oil exporter, and beyond.
        
        The U.S. has quietly been supplying military equipment, intelligence and training to Yemeni forces, who have raided suspected al-Qaida hideouts this month, U.S. defence and counterterrorism officials said.
        
        In a worrying development for U.S. security, officials have discovered that Abdulmutallab's father warned them of his son's growing radicalism, but this information failed to prevent his travelling to the U.S. on a two-year visa issued June 16, 2008.
        
        Obama said that as a result of this oversight, he had ordered a thorough review of the screening process.
        
        "We need to determine just how the suspect was able to bring dangerous explosives aboard an aircraft and what additional steps we can take to thwart future attacks," Obama said.
        
        Obama is under pressure from opposition Republicans who have been critical of his response to the Christmas Day scare and have questioned whether his administration is doing enough to contain security threats.
        
        His administration admitted Monday that the incident represented a failure of air security.
        
        Asked on NBC's Today show if the security system "failed miserably," U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano replied, "It did."
        
        On Sunday, Napolitano said the system to protect air travel worked, but in appearances on news shows Monday she said she had meant that the response to alert other flights and airports and impose immediate new safety procedures had been effective.
        
        Abdulmutallab was overpowered by passengers and crew on the Northwest Airlines flight 253 after setting alight an explosive device attached to his body. He was treated for burns and is in federal prison awaiting trial.
        
        NEW SECURITY MEASURES
        
        The U.S. Transportation Security Administration did not give details of its new security measures. But air travellers described new restrictions on flights headed for the U.S., including additional preflight screening, and -- an hour before landing -- a ban on movement around the cabin and on having items such as blankets on passengers' laps.
        
        The agency has since given pilots and flight crews discretion to ease these in-flight restrictions, a source familiar with the TSA rules said Monday.
        
        A TSA spokesperson declined to confirm the change, saying the agency "will continuously review and update these measures to ensure the highest levels of security."
        
        Senate Homeland Security chair Joe Lieberman, an independent who usually votes with Democrats, said he plans a January hearing to investigate the incident, including why Abdulmutallab was not checked against what the senator said was "our broadest list of suspected terrorists" and why body-imaging scanners are not used on more passengers.
        
        Dutch airport authorities said they planned to make new, more sensitive passenger scanners mandatory after Abdulmutallab allegedly smuggled explosives in his underwear through Schiphol Airport security.

    textlede: What we don't know may kill us; The Christmas Day terrorist attempt should make us think twice about how we're fighting -- or not fighting -- the war on terror.
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        The plot to blow up Northwest Airlines flight 253 on Christmas Day was, according to multiple news accounts, organized and launched by al-Qaeda leaders in Yemen. ABC News has reported that the Nigerian man who attempted to blow up a plane over Detroit, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, spent a month at an al-Qaeda compound north of Yemen's capital, Sanaa, where he completed training alongside a Saudi al-Qaeda bomb-maker.
        
        Little noted is the fact that the second in command of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- the group that reportedly trained and deployed Abdulmutallab for his mission to attack the American homeland -- is a released Guantanamo detainee: Said Ali al-Shihri. While al-Shihri's specific role has not been determined, it is increasingly clear that the terrorist network he helps lead was behind the attempted Detroit attack.
        
        Known to Guantanamo officials as Detainee No. 372, al-Shihri was captured on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border in December 2001. He denied being a terrorist and claimed to have traveled to Afghanistan two weeks after the 9/11 attacks to deliver money for the Red Crescent. At Guantanamo, he told officials that he had never even heard of al-Qaeda until he arrived in Guantanamo, and declared that "Usama bin Laden had no business representing Islam."
        
        He promised that if released he would return to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, reunite with his family and work in their used furniture store.
        
        Despite evidence that he had trained in an al-Qaeda camp north of Kabul, he was released in 2007 to a Saudi rehabilitation program. But al-Shihri never became a furniture salesman. Instead, last January, he appeared in a series of jihadist videos identified as al-Qaeda's second in command on the Arabian Peninsula. The New York Times reported that he is "suspected of involvement in a deadly bombing of the United States Embassy in Yemen's capital, Sanaa," in September 2008.
        
        A cautionary tale
        
        The connection between this former Guantanamo detainee and the most recent al-Qaeda plot to attack the homeland is a cautionary tale -- one that should give Americans pause about President Obama's plans to release more detainees and shut down the detention center at Guantanamo. Just days before the attempted attack in Detroit, the Obama administration transferred six more Guantanamo detainees to Yemen. According to the summary of evidence prepared by Guantanamo officials, one of those released, Farouq Ali Ahmed, was a member of al-Qaeda who was "observed carrying an AK-47 and wearing fatigues at UBL's private airport in Kandahar" and was captured with an organized group of mujahedin fighters after the fall of Tora Bora. Another, Ayman Saeed Abdullah Batarfi, admitted to Guantanamo officials that "he met with Usama Bin Laden on a number of occasions."
        
        Perhaps these men will now lead peaceful lives. Or they might, like al-Shihri, return to jihad. According to the Defense Intelligence Agency, at least 74 terrorists released from Guantanamo are believed to have returned to the fight. Those still at the facility, according to the Brookings Institution, include: 26 members of al-Qaeda's leadership cadre, 90 lower-level al-Qaeda operatives, eight members of the Taliban leadership, 81 foreign fighters and 11 Taliban fighters and operatives. Releasing such terrorists, or bringing them to America, is dangerous and misguided.
        
        Instead of looking for ways to release these dangerous men, we should be capturing and interrogating more of them for information on planned attacks. But that is something the U.S. no longer does. President Obama has shut down the CIA interrogation program that helped stop a series of planned attacks -- and in the year since he took office, not one high-value terrorist has been interrogated by the CIA.
        
        Meanwhile, the Obama administration has escalated the targeted killing of high-value terrorists. There may be times when killing a terrorist leader is the best option (for example, his location might be too remote to reach with anything but an unmanned drone). But President Obama has decided capturing senior terrorist leaders alive and interrogating them -- with enhanced techniques if necessary -- is not worth the trouble.
        
        Intelligence we'll never see
        
        The problem with this approach is that dead terrorists cannot tell their plans. According to ABC News, Abdulmutallab has told investigators there are "more just like him in Yemen who would strike soon."
        
        Who are these terrorists? Where have they been deployed? We may not find out until it is too late because we launched a strike intended to kill the al-Qaeda leaders who could give us vital intelligence.
        
        On Christmas Eve, U.S. and Yemeni forces struck a compound where senior al-Qaeda leaders were meeting. Among those believed killed, The Washington Post reported, were "Nasser al-Wuhayshi, al-Qaeda's regional leader, and his deputy, Said Ali al-Shihri."
        
        A U.S. official told the Post that they were "the two biggest fish in the most violent offshoot of al-Qaeda that exists in the world."
        
        Subsequent reports have indicated al-Wuhayshi might have survived. The fates of the two men remain unclear.
        
        In an earlier time, when we tracked down such big fish, we would take them in alive, hand them over to the CIA and find out their plans to kill Americans. No longer. If we had tried to capture, instead of kill, these two terrorist leaders, they could have told us whether more like Abdulmutallab were on the way. Now, they might have taken these secrets to the grave. And we are left to hope that the passengers on the next flight are as brave as those who subdued Abdulmutallab on Christmas Day.
        
        Marc A. Thiessen's new book, Courting Disaster: How the CIA Kept America Safe and How Barack Obama Is Inviting the Next Attack, will be published in January by Regnery.

    textlede: Al-Qaida's Yemen wing claims responsibility for attempted bombing of U.S. passenger jet; Group warns Americans to expect more attacks in retaliation for military raids
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        SANAA, Yemen -A regional wing of al-Qaida said it was behind the failed Christmas Day bombing of a U.S. passenger plane, which was meant to avenge U.S. attacks on the group in Yemen, according to a web statement posted on Monday.
        
        The group told Americans to expect more attacks, after the failed bomb plot turned the spotlight on the poor Arab country.
        
        The United States and Yemen's neighbour Saudi Arabia fear al-Qaida will use instability in the country to carry out attacks in the world's main oil exporting region and beyond.
        
        Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) said in the statement posted on Islamist websites that it had provided the Nigerian suspect with a "technically advanced device" but that it had failed to detonate because of a technical fault.
        
        The group said the attack was in retaliation for recent raids on its militants that it said had been carried out by U.S. jets and had caused many civilian deaths.
        
        "We tell the American people that since you support the leaders who kill our women and children ... we have come to slaughter you [and] will strike you with no previous [warning], our vengeance is near," the statement said.
        
        The Yemeni government says it carried out military raids on Dec. 17, in which more than 30 al-Qaida members were killed, and another on Dec. 24.
        
        Opposition groups said about 50 civilians were killed, including women and children.
        
        The New York Times has said Washington gave hardware, intelligence and other support to Yemeni forces for the raids.
        
        "We call on all Muslims ... to throw out all unbelievers from the Arabian Peninsula by killing crusaders who work in embassies or elsewhere ... [in] a total war on all crusaders in the Peninsula of [Prophet] Mohammad," the statement said.
        
        Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab is charged with trying to blow up a Delta Airlines plane as it approached Detroit on a flight from Amsterdam with almost 300 people on board.
        
        Besides al-Qaida, Yemen is also grappling with a Shiite revolt in the north and a separatist movement in the south with both complaining of social and economic discrimination, something the government denies.
        
        On Monday, a spokesman for the northern rebels rejected as "fictitious" reports that rebel leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi had been killed in the fighting, Al Jazeera TV's website said.
        
        Yemen's national security chief Ali Mohammad Al-Ansi told a state-run website that 29 al-Qaida members had been arrested.
        
        "There will be more operations awaiting terrorist elements and their nests," the Defence Ministry website quoted an unidentified security official as saying.

    textlede: Pakistan: Attempted bombing spotlights al Qaeda growth in Yemen
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        WASHINGTON, Dec. 28 -- An attempted Christmas Day bombing of a U.S. passenger jet has put a spotlight on the Middle East state of Yemen which American spy agencies see as a rapidly growing hub for al Qaeda.Civil war and lawlessness have turned the Arab world's poorest state into an attractive alternative base for al Qaeda, which U.S. officials say has been largely pushed out of Afghanistan and is under growing military pressure from the Pakistani army in bordering tribal areas.Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, 23, is charged with attempting to blow up a Northwest Airlines plane as it approached Detroit on a flight from Amsterdam with almost 300 people on board.In U.S. questioning, Abdulmutallab claimed that al Qaeda operatives in Yemen supplied him with an explosive device and trained him on how to detonate it, an official said.Al Qaeda's presence in Yemen has grown over the last year and Washington fears it could become a central base of operations outside Pakistan and Afghanistan, according to U.S. counterterrorism officials and experts.The United States has quietly been supplying military equipment, intelligence and training to Yemeni forces, who have raided suspected al Qaeda hide-outs this month, they said.U.S. officials declined to discuss specific assistance. But in September, U.S. President Barack Obama sent a letter to Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh promising to help the government fight against terrorism, according to the Yemeni state news agency Saba.Senator Joseph Lieberman, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, said on "Fox News Sunday" that the United States had"growing presence" in Yemen which included Special Operations, Green Berets and intelligence.'TOMORROW'S WAR'Lieberman, who recently visited Sanaa, the capital of Yemen, said a U.S. government official there told him that "Iraq was yesterday's war.
        
        Afghanistan is today's war. If we don't act preemptively, Yemen will be tomorrow's war."In recent congressional testimony, Mike Leiter, director of the National Counter Terrorism Center, called Yemen "a key battleground and potential regional base of operations from which al Qaeda can plan attacks, train recruits, and facilitate the movement of operatives.""Of particular concern to the FBI are individuals who can travel with fewer restrictions to these areas of extremist activity and then enter the United States under less scrutiny," FBI Director Robert Mueller told lawmakers.Yemen has been a long-standing base of support for al Qaeda. Militants bombed the Navy warship USS Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden in 2000, killing 17 U.S. sailors, and Yemenis were one of the largest groups to train in al Qaeda's camps in Afghanistan before September 11, 2001 attacks.Of the 198 prisoners left at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, which Obama has vowed to close, 91 are from Yemen, and talks over repatriating them have bogged down due to concerns they will join al Qaeda once they return.Since Saudi and Yemeni militants united earlier this year under the name "Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula" with Yemen as their base, there has been a "steady uptick" in the group's activities, said Christopher Boucek, an expert with the Carnegie Endowment in Washington."Yemen has rapidly become a very important secondary front" in al Qaeda's global ambitions, Boucek said, with the "greatest growth potential" because the government has been unable to exert control over its own territory.Besides combating al Qaeda militants, Yemen is fighting Shi'ite rebels in the north and faces separatist sentiment in the south.Fearing instability in Yemen could turn into a security threat for the kingdom, Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, began attacking Yemen's Shi'ite Muslim rebels, known as the Houthis, in early November after the rebels staged a cross-border incursion and killed two Saudi border guards.

    textlede: U.S. Widens the Terror War To Yemen, a Qaeda Bastion
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        In the midst of two unfinished major wars, the United States has quietly opened a third, largely covert front against Al Qaeda in Yemen.
        
        A year ago, the Central Intelligence Agency sent several of its top field operatives with counterterrorism experience to the country, according a former top agency official. At the same time, some of the most secretive Special Operations commandos have begun training Yemeni security forces in counterterrorism tactics, senior military officers said.
        
        The Pentagon is spending more than $70 million over the next 18 months, and using teams of Special Forces, to train and equip Yemeni military, Interior Ministry and coast guard forces, more than doubling previous military aid levels.
        
        As American investigators sought to corroborate the claims of a 23-year-old Nigerian man that Qaeda leaders in Yemen had trained and equipped him to blow up a Detroit-bound Northwest Airlines jet on Christmas Day, the plot casts a spotlight on the Obama administration's complicated relationship with Yemen.
        
        The country has long been a refuge for jihadists, in part because Yemen's government welcomed returning Islamist fighters who had fought in Afghanistan during the 1980s. The Yemen port of Aden was the site of the audacious bombing of the American destroyer Cole in October 2000 by Qaeda militants, which killed 17 sailors.
        
        But Qaeda militants have made much more focused efforts to build a base in Yemen in recent years, drawing recruits from throughout the region and mounting attacks more frequently on foreign embassies and other targets. The White House is seeking to nurture enduring ties with the government of President Ali Abdullah Saleh and prod him to combat the local Qaeda affiliate, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, even as his impoverished country grapples with seemingly intractable internal turmoil.
        
        With fears also growing of a resurgent Islamist extremism in nearby Somalia and East Africa, administration officials and American lawmakers said Yemen could become Al Qaeda's next operational and training hub, rivaling the lawless tribal areas of Pakistan where the organization's top leaders operate.
        
        "Yemen now becomes one of the centers of that fight," said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut and chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, who visited the country in August.
        
        "We have a growing presence there, and we have to, of Special Operations, Green Berets, intelligence," he said on "Fox News Sunday."
        
        American and Yemeni officials said that a pivotal point in the relationship was reached in late summer after separate secret visits to Yemen by Gen. David H. Petraeus, the American regional commander, and John O. Brennan, President Obama's counterterrorism adviser.
        
        President Saleh agreed to expanded overt and covert assistance in response to growing pressure from the United States and Yemen's neighbors, notably Saudi Arabia, from which many Qaeda operatives had fled to Yemen, as well as a rising threat against the country's political inner circle, the officials said.
        
        "Yemen's security problems won't just stay in Yemen," said Christopher Boucek, who studies Yemen as an associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.
        
        "They're regional problems and they affect Western interests."
        
        Al Qaeda's profile in Yemen rose sharply a year ago, when a former Guantanamo Bay detainee from Saudi Arabia, Said Ali al-Shihri, fled to Yemen to join Al Qaeda and appeared in a video posted online. Several other former Guantanamo detainees have also joined the group.
        
        Yemen's remote areas are notoriously lawless, but the country's chaos has worsened in the past two years, as the government struggles with an armed rebellion in the northwest and a rising secessionist movement in the south. Yemen is running out of oil, and the government's dwindling finances have affected its ability to strike at Al Qaeda.
        
        Meanwhile, there have been increasing Yemeni ties to plots against the United States. A Muslim man charged in the June 1 killing of a soldier at a recruiting center in a mall in Little Rock, Ark., had traveled to Yemen, prompting a review by the F.B.I. of other domestic extremists who had visited the country.
        
        A radical cleric in Yemen, Anwar al-Awlaki, has been linked to numerous terrorism suspects, including Nidal Malik Hasan, the American Army major who faces murder charges in the shooting deaths of 13 people at Fort Hood, Tex., in November.
        
        In the latest issue of Sada al-Malahim, the Internet magazine of the Qaeda affiliate in Yemen, the group's leader, Nasser al-Wuhayshi, praised the use of small bombs -- not just big ones -- to attack an enemy, in an eerie foreshadowing of Friday's episode on the plane to Detroit.
        
        Yemen escalated its campaign against Al Qaeda with major airstrikes on Dec. 17 and last Thursday that killed more than 60 militants.
        
        American officials have been coy about the role of the United States in the strikes, saying that they have provided intelligence and "firepower" for the efforts.
        
        Yemen's foreign minister, Abu Bakr al-Qirbi, said Sunday that Yemeni military cooperation with the United States and Saudi Arabia had increased in recent months as fresh intelligence confirmed Al Qaeda's greater assertiveness in the country.
        
        "There was intelligence that they were targeting the British Embassy and a number of government institutions as well as private schools," Mr. Qirbi said in a telephone interview.
        
        "The second reason is that they have become more vocal, trying to show that they can undertake terrorist activities in an open fashion. So the government had to respond to that."
        
        The recent airstrikes were planned for two or three months, Mr. Qirbi said, but could not take place until there was fresh intelligence about the location of the Qaeda operatives who were the targets.
        
        He called that intelligence -- which included information provided by the United States -- "the most important element" in the successful strike on the Qaeda members.
        
        Mr. Qirbi added that although the United States provided Yemen with military hardware, the airstrikes were carried out by the Yemeni military alone.
        
        Although the most important intelligence came from the United States and Saudi Arabia, other countries in the region have increased their financial assistance in recent months to help Yemen, said Mustafa Alani, a security analyst at the Gulf Research Center in Dubai.
        
        "There was a fear inside and outside Yemen that Al Qaeda was taking new ground, establishing training centers, making some parts of Yemen no-go areas," Mr. Alani said. The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait in particular provided assistance, he said, because "they feel that sooner or later they will become targets too."
        
        In the past year, Al Qaeda has killed six intelligence officers in the provinces where it is based, part of an unmistakable campaign by the group to secure its sanctuary there, Mr. Alani said. The intelligence officers were trying to gather information on the group, and to disrupt its growing links with local tribes -- a significant part of its strategy, Mr. Alani added.
        
        The airstrikes of the past two weeks have been successful but have come at a price, Yemeni officials said.
        
        "They have been hit hard, but they have not yet been disabled," said one high-ranking Yemeni official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic issues involved.
        
        "The problem is that the involvement of theUnited States creates sympathy for Al Qaeda. The cooperation is necessary -- but there is no doubt that it has an effect for the common man. He sympathizes with Al Qaeda."
        
        As if to reaffirm that message, Al Qaeda's Yemeni affiliate released a statement to Internet sites on Sunday that put strong emphasis on the American role in the recent raids, deriding the Yemeni government for claiming responsibility.

        THE CLIMATE change conference conformed to the two universal rules of meetings the more people involved, the less chance of agreement on anything practical. And the people with the smallest stake always make the most mischief. Even with the statement that was expected to be stitched together overnight, the conference constituted two wasted weeks that will make no dramatic or early difference to global greenhouse gas emissions. And while the green extreme argues that this is the fault of the developed economies, the reality is that they never got a chance to hammer out a deal on behalf of all the people on the planet.
        
        Copenhagen failed because it was hijacked by participants with other agendas especially underdeveloped nations, including the Africans. While no one really knows what the impact of global warming will be on individual countries, poor nations have used it as an opportunity to extract more aid from the developed world. Not that they need help to reduce their carbon emissions. Given the incompetence of many African governments, their people do not have access to electricity at all, let alone rely on large and polluting power plants. Rather, the continent s main sources of carbon output are entirely natural, animals, fires and the occasional volcanic eruption which all the aid in the world will not stop.
        
        And so the Africans tried to turn Copenhagen into a summit on world poverty and ways to expand their economies with green energy, using climate change as leverage to seek more money from donor nations including China. Certainly there is a case for the developed world to fund developing nations mitigation and abatement efforts, [b]ut handing over compensation for wrongs done in the distant colonial past, without proper reporting of what the money is be used for, will only perpetuate the aid-dependency and its attendant corruption that has trapped large parts of the developing world in penury.
        
        THE AUSTRALIAN (Sydney)
        
        FEW MIGHT have expected the UN Climate Change Conference at Copenhagen \.\.\. to throw up a game-changer of a deal. Yet, even lowered expectations could hardly stem the disappointment many people felt over the final outcome a last-minute accord that was weaker than not only a legally binding treaty but also the expected political agreement.
        
        Even so, the Copenhagen Accord represents a step forward, although not enough, in the battle against global warming. The next UN-backed climate summit will take place a year from now in Mexico City, but there is no time to waste. It is imperative that all nations act now to make the Copenhagen Accord a stepping-stone to a new climate treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol.
        
        The conference was widely touted as an important opportunity to boost international co-operation in combating climate change. Two weeks of wrangling later, sharp divisions between the rich and poor nations over how to fight the fight have been laid bare.
        
        It is clear now that developing and developed nations have different historical and emission responsibilities and vary in current emission levels due to different development stages\.\.\. .
        
        Be that as it may, leaders who turned up at Copenhagen still deserve credit for inking a sub-optimal deal, rather than leaving with nothing at all\.\.\. .
        
        THE (Beijing) CHINA DAILY
        
        THE NEWS of a dozen Guantanamo detainees being returned to their home countries is welcome.
        
        While it denotes progress on the detention closure front, it also highlights the challenges the returning detainees are likely to pose. U.S. President Barack Obama s deadline of the end of January 2010 is likely to be extended. It may be for technical reasons, complicated congressional requirements and placement of an alternative judicial recourse to deal with the detainees.
        
        As part of the closure plans, the U.S. has been engaged with governments that are willing to take back their nationals. Washington was hoping to send at least 116 of the detainees back before January. The ones short-listed for repatriation are mainly suspects who, due to inconclusive evidence, could not be charged, even after being illegally detained for years and having undergone extreme interrogation. Strangely, while the majority of detainees to be repatriated are cleared by the U.S., many have been refused entry into their home countries. It is primarily because their governments perceive these returnees as potential security threat. The fear, not unfounded, is that such persons would be more prone to terrorism as a retaliatory measure and would pose a bigger challenge in terms of monitoring. Even detaining them in prisons at home could foment problems among other prisoners. In the face of resistance from some home states, the U.S. government [is considering] arrangement with third states that may be willing to accept them.
        
        The latest batch of detainees to return to their countries comprise six Yemenis, four Afghans and two Somalians. With Yemeni nationals comprising the largest number of detainees at Guantanamo, Washington is hoping to repatriate more, depending on how this transfer goes. Previously, the escape of 23 al-Qaeda suspects from a high-security prison in Sanaa in 2006 led to serious complications. Some of the escapees were on the U.S. most-wanted list of terrorists. One Nasser al-Wahishi successfully reorganised and brought into operation a resurgent entity, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.

    textlede: Our false sense of security must end here: al-Qaeda never went away
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        There has been a tendency in the past year to write off al-Qaeda. The core of Osama bin Laden's group has lost a significant number of key personnel to US drone attacks in the Pakistani tribal areas. In Britain we have not seen an al-Qaeda-directed terrorist plot since the plan to detonate liquid explosives on transatlantic flights was foiled in August 2006.
        
        The attack the following year on Glasgow airport and the Tiger Tiger nightclub on Haymarket, Central London, was considered to have been inspired, rather than directed, by al-Qaeda.
        
        The belief that al-Qaeda had been diminished contributed to the decision in July to lower the terrorist threat level in Britain from severe to substantial.
        
        However, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab's alleged attempt to blow himself up on an aircraft coming into Detroit is a warning that core al-Qaeda has not gone away.
        
        Intelligence analysts will be focusing on the new twists to the al-Qaeda script. The supposed martyr's time in Yemen will be of particular interest, and extensive intelligence resources will be deployed to try to discover with whom he associated while there.
        
        The recently formed al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, as the group based in the country calls itself, is believed to include key figures from the movement who may have relocated from Afghanistan and Pakistan.
        
        Also hiding in Yemen is the American extremist cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was imam to some of the 9/11 hijackers and who inspired Malik Nadal Hasan to carry out the Fort Hood shootings. There are already informed reports that Mr Abdulmutallab met Mr al-Awlaki during his final weeks of training and indoctrination for his supposed suicide mission.
        
        Mr al-Awlaki was also a frequent visitor to Britain, preaching at major mosques and religious events. The Times understands that the cleric was banned from entering Britain in 2006. As the preacher was being excluded, Mr Abdulmutallab was studying at University College London. His life during his three years in Britain will be dissected and inquiries made into whom he met and socialised with, where he worshipped and whom he might have influenced.
        
        While al-Qaeda's structure may have been shaken it has not been destroyed and it is known for its resilience and reinvention. More significantly, its ideology of intolerance and suicidal violence spreads easily via the internet and is embedded in sections of the British Muslim population, notably on many university campuses.
        
        The ideology is today more potent than the organisation and there are still a significant number of people in Britain who want to put it into practice here or overseas. Al-Qaeda and its mindset remain a danger.
        
        Some of the more draconian counter-terrorism powers such as stop and search are being relaxed. The agencies fighting terrorism, however, worry about complacency and point out that a substantial threat means that "an attack is a strong possibility". One senior Whitehall official said: "The threat level is substantial for a reason - we don't make this stuff up."

    textlede: Dubai: 34 suspected Al-Qaeda killed in Yemen
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Pakistan, Dec. 26 -- Yemeni forces killed 34 suspected Al-Qaeda members, including senior leaders, in a dawn raid in a remote mountainous region of Yemen's Shabwa province, a security source said."The raid was carried out as dozens of members of Al-Qaeda were meeting in Wadi Rafadh," said the source, referring to a rugged location about 650 kilometres (400 miles) east of the Yemeni capital.The head of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, Nasser al-Wahishi and his deputy, Saeed al-Saudi Shahrani, were present at the meeting, said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity.He added that "members of the group's leadership, including Saad al-Fathani and Mohammad Ahmed Saleh al-Omir, were among those killed."The source was unable to say what had happened to Wahishi or his deputy, but he indicated that Omir had recently appeared in a video made of a public meeting in southern Abyan province which was later screened by Al-Jazeera television."Saudis and Iranians at the Wadi Rafadh meeting were also among the dead," said the source, without going into detail.A second security source told AFP that the raid had been launched after locals had tipped the authorities off about the meeting in Wadi Rafadh.The Yemeni defence ministry cited a source in the High Security Council as confirming Thursday's raid in Shabwa but gave no death toll."Security forces will continue to hunt for terrorists... and thwart their criminal plans," the defence ministry quoted the source as saying.A Yemeni official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP that those attending the meeting "planned to launch terrorist attacks against economic installations in Yemen, in retaliation for Yemeni strikes launched last week."A December 17 Yemeni air strike on one of the group's training camps in Abyan province killed 34 Al-Qaeda members, according to the Yemeni government.A local official and a tribal source said that 49 civilians, including 23 women and 17 children, were among those killed in that strike.On the same day, four members of Al-Qaeda were killed in Abhar, about 35 kilometres north of Sanaa, in what authorities presented as part of preventative operations against Al-Qaeda members planning attacks.The Yemeni defence ministry said on Thursday that 29 Al-Qaeda members had been arrested in Yemen since the December 17 strike, revising an earlier figure of 30.Deputy Prime Minister for Defence and Security Rashid al-Alimi raised the issue in parliament on Wednesday, saying the "fight against terrorism and the eradication of extremism is a national emergency," according to the official Saba news agency.Thursday's strike brings the Yemeni government's tally of Al-Qaeda members killed over the past eight days to 68.The New York Times reported that US President Barack Obama approved firepower, intelligence and other support for Yemen's efforts against Al-Qaeda.Yemen, Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Ladin's ancestral homeland, has witnessed a number of attacks in recent years against targets including diplomatic missions, oil installations and foreign tourists.

    textlede: 34 Qaeda men killed in Yemen airstrike
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        SANAA, Dec. 25 -- A Yemeni air raid may have killed the top two leaders of Al Qaeda's regional branch on Thursday, and an American Muslim preacher linked to the man who shot dead 13 people at a US army base may also have died, a Yemeni security official said.
        
        Nasser al-Wahayshi, the Yemeni leader of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), and his Saudi deputy, Saeed al-Shehri, were believed to be among 34 militants killed in the dawn operation in the eastern province of Shabwa, security sources said. US-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki may also have died in the airstrike which targeted a meeting of militants planning attacks on Yemeni and foreign oil and economic targets, he said. If all the deaths are confirmed, the airstrike would appear to have struck a severe blow against AQAP, seen as the most dangerous regional offshoot of Osama Bin Laden's network.
        
        Fort Hood link: "Anwar al-Awlaki is suspected to be dead," the official said of the cleric who was on the run in Yemen, where he was on the government's most-wanted list of terrorist suspects. According to US officials, the U.S. army psychiatrist who ran amok at the Fort Hood army base in Texas on November 5 had contacts with Awlaki.
        
        The Yemeni official said one leading figure in AQAP, Muhammad Saleh Omair, was confirmed dead in Thursday's raid. The United States cooperates closely with Yemen in combating Al Qaeda militancy. Pentagon officials were not immediately available to comment on any US involvement in the raid.
        
        The Yemeni official mentioned only one airstrike, which a government website said had taken place at 5am, but Al Arabiya television reported four raids. Resurgent Al Qaeda attacks have stirred fears that worsening instability in Yemen, an impoverished country struggling with multiple security threats, might enable militants to launch renewed attacks in neighbouring oil superpower Saudi Arabia. Al Qaeda's wing in Yemen, where Osama Bin Laden's father was born, announced in January it had changed its name to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula - in an apparent attempt to revive the group in Saudi Arabia, where a tough counter-terrorism drive had halted the group's three-year armed campaign in 2006. Wahayshi, the new group's Yemeni leader, threatened attacks against Westerners in the oil-exporting region. AQIP has also called for the overthrow of the US-allied Saudi royal family.

    textlede: 'FORT HOOD' IMAM BLOWN UP: YEMEN
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        The hate-spewing imam who counseled the Fort Hood massacre gunman is believed to have been killed along with senior al Qaeda officials in Yemen airstrikes.
        
        More than 30 terrorists died yesterday when Yemeni jets, backed by US intelligence, blasted al Qaeda lairs in the province of Shabwa before dawn, Yemeni officials said.
        
        Among those believed killed in the raids was New Mexico-born Anwar al Awlaki, an anti-American cleric who was in e-mail contact with Maj. Nidal Hasan more than a year before Hasan, a psychologist, massacred 12 soldiers and one civilian at Fort Hood in Texas.
        
        After the Nov. 5 bloodbath, Awlaki boasted that he was Hasan's spiritual adviser and that Hasan had asked him if killing US soldiers was permitted by Islamic law.
        
        Awlaki, who is a former imam at mosques in Denver, San Diego and Falls Church, Va., had been on the run in Yemen, where he was giving fiery anti-American sermons and had been placed on the Yemen government's most-wanted list.
        
        Yemeni officials said he was believed killed at a meeting in the remote valley town of Rafd, where militants were planning attacks on the British Embassy, foreign schools and oil targets in retaliation for the Yemeni government's fierce crackdown on terrorists. Preparation for the attacks "was in the final stage," the government said.
        
        A Yemen newspaper said the government also destroyed Awlaki's home.
        
        Yemen, where Osama bin Laden's father was born, became a focal point in the war on terror earlier this year when Saudi and Yemeni militants said they were uniting there under the name "al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula."
        
        Yemen's deputy defense minister, Rashad al-Alaimy, told his parliament yesterday that the strikes killed three important members of the group, but he did not identify them.
        
        However, security officials said the leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , Abu Basir Nasser al-Wahayshi, and his deputy, Saeed al-Shehri, were at the meeting.
        
        Al-Shehri is a former Guantanamo inmate who was transferred to a prison in his native Saudi Arabia in 2007 but escaped and is suspected of recruiting ex-Gitmo captives into al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.
        
        Alaimy said the strikes were carried out "using intelligence aid from Saudi Arabia and the United States of America in our fight against terrorism."
        
        Security sources said they were tipped off about the terrorist meeting by villagers.

    textlede: Yemen strikes at al-Qaeda meeting; U.S.-aided attack may have killed cleric linked to Fort Hood suspect
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Yemeni forces, backed by the United States, launched a major attack Thursday on a meeting of senior al-Qaeda operatives thought to include the Yemeni American cleric linked to the suspect in the Fort Hood shootings, U.S. and Yemeni officials said.
        
        U.S. officials believe that the cleric, Anwar al-Aulaqi, was probably killed in the assault, as were two al-Qaeda leaders, according to a senior Obama administration official.
        
        One of those leaders was the head of the terrorist network's operations on the Arabian Peninsula and once served as Osama bin Laden's personal secretary; the other was a Saudi national and former detainee at the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
        
        Yemeni officials, tribal leaders and eyewitnesses said it was not clear whether Aulaqi and the al-Qaeda leaders were killed or wounded in the strike. They cautioned that it could take days for authorities to identify the dead.
        
        Still, the U.S. involvement in the strike in southeastern Yemen -- along with a similar strike in the country last week -- appears to reflect greater willingness by the Obama administration to use military force in confronting terrorists outside the traditional war zones of Iraq and Afghanistan. Last week's strike was seen at the time as the most significant example of the new approach, according to a senior U.S. official with knowledge of the planning and execution of the attack.
        
        It was not clear whether U.S. firepower was employed in either attack. A U.S. official said the United States did provide intelligence and other support.
        
        The Thursday assault killed at least 30 suspected militants, according to Yemeni security and government sources. In a statement, the Yemeni Embassy in Washington said Aulaqi was thought to be at the meeting, as were Nasser al-Wuhayshi, al-Qaeda's regional leader, and his deputy, Said Ali al-Shihri.
        
        A U.S. official identified the two al-Qaeda leaders as "the two biggest fish in the most violent offshoot of al-Qaeda that exists in the world."
        
        "This is a decapitating strike on al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula," said the official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter on the record.
        
        Yemen's government, with increasing assistance from the United States, has been intensifying its crackdown on alleged hideouts of al-Qaeda, which in recent years has expanded its presence in this poor yet strategic Middle Eastern nation where bin Laden's father was born. The U.S. government is increasingly concerned that al-Qaeda could create a haven in Yemen, whose weak central government is struggling with a civil war in the north, a secessionist movement in the south and a crumbling economy.
        
        Aulaqi was among the latest reasons for U.S. concern in Yemen, officials said. The radical cleric, a native of New Mexico and a former imam at Dar al-Hijrah mosque in Falls Church, had contact with three of the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackers and frequently delivered lectures advocating violent jihad that attracted legions of followers, especially among radical Muslims in the West.
        
        He also exchanged e-mails with Maj. Nidal M. Hasan, who is suspected of opening fire on his fellow soldiers at Fort Hood, Tex., on Nov. 5, leaving 13 dead. Aulaqi praised Hasan in interviews and on his Web site, calling the Army psychiatrist a "hero" for killing American military personnel.
        
        U.S. officials said Aulaqi was a member of al-Qaeda and has been moving up the ranks, having recently been promoted to regional commander. But the officials described him less as an operational leader than an inspirational one, whose contacts with members took place largely online.
        
        The Yemen Observer, a paper with ties to the government, reported that Aulaqi's house was "raided and demolished" in Thursday's strike.
        
        But in interviews, Aulaqi's distraught relatives said they have had no official word about the cleric. They said they had spoken with relatives and friends in Shabwa province, the site of the assault, and do not believe that he was among those killed.
        
        The cleric's father, a former Yemeni minister of agriculture, Nasser al-Aulaqi, said his son was living in the home of an uncle and, he believed, had left that residence about two months ago. The uncle's house is more than 40 miles from the attack site, the elder Aulaqi said in a rare interview.
        
        "If the American government helped in attacking one of [its own] citizens, this is illegal," the father said, his voice cracking.
        
        "Nidal Hasan killed 13 people and he's going to get a trial. My son has killed nobody. He should face trial if he's done something wrong."
        
        "If Obama wants to kill my son, this is wrong," he said, adding that despite his son's ideology, the younger Aulaqi had no links to al-Qaeda.
        
        It would be highly unusual, though not unprecedented, for a U.S.-backed strike to kill an American citizen. A CIA missile strike by a pilotless aircraft killed Ahmed Hijazi, a U.S. citizen, in Yemen in 2002, in an attack aimed at suspected al-Qaeda members.
        
        Yemeni officials had largely left Anwar al-Aulaqi alone since he gained international attention because of the Fort Hood attacks. In interviews this week before the Thursday attack, officials said the United States has provided little proof for them to take the cleric into custody. But they acknowledged that they had kept a close watch over him.
        
        "He's under scrutiny by our security forces," Yemeni Foreign Minister Abubaker al-Qirbi said Monday.
        
        "We're looking at this from a legal point of view. From his statements on his Web sites alone, there is a question whether he can be prosecuted on this basis."
        
        Shabwa is a known haven for al-Qaeda militants. Yemeni security and government sources said the dead in Thursday's attack included suspected al-Qaeda members of Yemeni and foreign nationalities, but they would not elaborate. Al-Qaeda here is made up largely of Yemeni and Saudi nationals, according to analysts.
        
        Tribal leaders and eyewitnesses said they buried five al-Qaeda operatives after the assault. Lahmar bin Salfooh, a tribal chief, said all five were from Aulaqi's tribe, which dominates Shabwa province.
        
        In the Fallujah Forum, an online discussion forum for al-Qaeda sympathizers in Yemen, participants said Shabwa residents had noticed yellow-and-green military-style spotter balloons floating above the area in the three days before the strike, said Evan F.

    textlede: Deaths in Yemen raid on al-Qaeda
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        As many as 34 suspected al-Qaeda fighters have been killed in a dawn air raid by Yemeni forces in the eastern Yemeni province of Shabwa, according to reports citing security sources.
        
        The raid, launched early on Thursday morning, appeared to target two senior members of al-Qaeda in the Arabian peninsula. The AFP news agency quoted a security source as saying: "The raid was carried out as dozens of members of al-Qaeda were meeting in Wadi Rafadh."
        
        The remote mountainous region lies about 650km east of the Yemeni capital Sanaa.
        
        Nasser al-Whaychi, the head of al-Qaeda in the Arabic Peninsula, was thought to have been present at the meeting but it as not known if he was killed in the raid. Unconfirmed deaths Initial reports said that two other al-Qaeda commanders, identified by security sources as Saad al-Fathani and Mohammad Ahmed Saleh al-Oumir, were among those killed. But there was no official confirmation that any the men had been killed in the raid. The Reuters news agency quoted an unnamed security official as saying the al-Qaeda fighters have been planning an attack on Yemeni and foreign oil targets. Al-Oumir is thought to have been the man who spoke at a rally in Abyane, a rare public appearance by an al-Qaeda leader, footage of which was obtained by Al Jazeera. Thursday's attack comes a week after the raid on Abyane, which prompted the rally at which al-Oumir appeared and which allegedly killed dozens of civilians as well as al-Qaeda fighters. Yemen's government has been battling al-Qaeda in the country at the same time as dealing with a Shia uprising in the north and rising secessionist sentiment in the south.

    textlede: Yemen's air strike on Al Qaeda may signal new US focus; Yemen's air strike Thursday targeting Al Qaeda hideouts and perhaps Anwar al-Awlaki, the cleric linked to the Fort Hood shooter, was the second conducted with US assistance in a week.
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        A series of air strikes in Yemen Thursday may have targeted the radical cleric who associated with alleged Fort Hood shooter Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan.The air strikes on Al Qaeda hideouts, the second in a week conducted by the Yemeni government with US assistance, may have also targeted Anwar al-Awlaki, an American cleric living in Yemen. The Washington Post, which has reporters on the ground in Yemen, said that as many as 30 suspected militants were killed. It was not clear if Mr. al-Awlaki, who had extensive contact with Hasan over the last year, was killed in the attack.The Post cited a local news source with ties to the government as saying that the Awlaki property in Shabwa province was "raided and demolished"; but it also quoted family members of al-Awlaki saying they did not believe the cleric was at the location targeted.It was the second such strike in a week, and though US officials won't confirm their involvement, increased military aid for Yemen this year suggests a new US focus in the war on terrorism.Last week, an air strike appeared to have taken out more than a couple dozen militants based on operations using American firepower and intelligence sought by the Yemeni government.On Thursday, US government officials issued statements in support of Yemen.
        
        "We strongly support Yemeni actions against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula which poses a serious threat to Yemeni, US and regional interests," said one official in Washington.Links to Fort HoodHasan, an Army psychiatrist, is the alleged shooter in the Fort Hood rampage Nov. 5 that took the lives of 13 soldiers and injured 30 more. Hasan was in contact via e-mail to al-Awlaki, a Yemeni American whose preachings are sympathetic to Al Qaeda. The e-mails were intercepted by Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) officials in December last year but held to be harmless.However, ABC reported Thursday that in an interview with Al Jazeera earlier this week, the preacher claimed Hasan had asked in an e-mail whether it was OK to kill fellow US soldiers, among other things.A haven for Al QaedaWith an estimated presence of more than 1,000 Al Qaeda operatives, Yemen is steadily becoming more important in the war against terrorism. It is a large country on the Arabian Peninsula with some 22 million people with an unemployment rate of about 40 percent that is expected to double in the next few decades. The availability of water is dwindling, and the oil revenues upon which the country depends are quickly evaporating. By 2017, those revenues are expected to bottom out, according to a report published by BP and cited in a report by the Center for a New American Security (CNAS), a think tank in Washington.All these factors make the country susceptible to militants who seek a haven to train and plan operations not only against western interests but to destabilize the region. Yet as in Pakistan, the US confronts a complex political challenge in Yemen. It must support the fragile government to take action against extremism, while avoiding being seen as having undue influence on Sana'a, the capital.New US aid for YemenThe US has spent about $70 million this year to support training and buy equipment for Yemen, compared with no funding last year, according to the Associated Press. Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on his military jet as he returned from Iraq and Afghanistan Sunday said he is comfortable with the level of support the US is currently providing."We've actually done quite a bit there, I think we're on a pretty good track," he said. He added, referring to Yemen government's first set of raids,"I really do applaud what they did, who they went after and specifically going after the Al Qaeda cell which has grown significantly over the last couple of years there."The CNAS report argues that the US must make a deep, long-term commitment to Yemen. That does not necessarily mean just deploying large military forces or sending millions more in aid, the report says, but marshaling "an array of instruments, including diplomacy, development assistance, and the effective use of political and economic leverage."---Follow us on Twitter.

    textlede: Pakistan:US Congress worries over Obama's plan for Pakistan
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        WASHINGTON, Dec. 05 -- The presence of Al Qaeda in the tribal areas and the fear that the insurgents may be seeking nuclear weapons made Pakistan the focus of America's new war strategy, senior US officials told a Senate panel on Thursday.'The Taliban regained momentum in Afghanistan and the extremist threat grew in Pakistan, a country . with 175 million people, a nuclear arsenal, and more than its share of challenges,' Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.'So it was against this backdrop that the president called for this careful, thorough review of our strategy.'Chairman of the committee Senator John Kerry backed her, saying that 'what happens in Pakistan ... will do more to determine the outcome in Afghanistan than any increase in troops or shift in strategy'.Opening a hearing on Obama's Afghan strategy, Senator Kerry said that it was the 'presence of Al Qaeda in Pakistan, its direct ties to and support from the Taliban in Afghanistan and the perils of an unstable, nuclear-armed Pakistan that drive our mission.'Senator Richard Lugar, the ranking Republican on the committee, asked Secretary Clinton, Defence Secretary Robert Gates and Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to explain how the new strategy would promote a stronger alliance with Pakistan and enable them to uproot Al Qaeda safe havens from Fata.He warned that Pakistan's nuclear weapons made it a riskier landscape than Afghanistan.US intelligence officials claim that only about 100 Al Qaeda operatives remain in Afghanistan and that while they have great influence over the larger Taliban network, Al Qaeda's base has moved to Pakistan.'It is not clear how any expanded military effort in Afghanistan addresses the problem of Taliban and Al Qaeda safe havens across the border in Pakistan,' asked Senator Lugar.'If these safe havens persist, any strategy in Afghanistan will be substantially incomplete.'Admiral Mullen assured Senator Lugar that Pakistan was a 'critical part' of the three-month strategy-drafting process and agreed that the link between the trajectory of both countries was 'almost absolute'.'There was an enormous amount of time spent on Pakistan,' he said, adding that a 'long-term partnership' was needed with the Pakistan government.'The outcome in Afghanistan bears directly on Pakistan's future.'
        
        The relationship between Al Qaeda and various insurgent and terrorist networks in Fata was also endorsed by Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen.Secretary Clinton described these groups as a syndicate headed by Al Qaeda. 'At the head of the table', like a 'Mafia family', sat Al Qaeda. And that means, she told the Senate panel, that Al Qaeda retained a capability to export terrorism to 'Yemen, Somalia or, indeed, Denver'.This was a reference to the recently arrested Najibullah Zazi, who allegedly was trained in Fata for setting up Al Qaeda cells in the United States, a charge he denies.'This is no idle danger; no hypothetical threat,' President Obama said in his speech at West Point.'In the last few months alone, we have apprehended extremists within our borders who were sent here from the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan to commit new acts of terror."The reality,' Gates told the panel, 'is that Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, place high value on their affiliation with Al Qaeda on that border (Fata) and there is ample intelligence' of others forming and seeking to reach back to the capabilities of Al Qaeda's leadership in Pakistan.Separately, Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security, told an audience in Washington on Thursday that there was a significant risk that 'recent arrests' in the US showed that terrorists had been 'sent here from the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan to commit more acts of terror'.She said that Zazi's connections to Al Qaeda's senior leadership in that region were 'at most one step removed'.

    textlede: The Hasan case: overt clues and tactical challenges
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        HIGHLIGHT: In last week's global security and intelligence report, we discussed the recent call by the leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, Nasir al-Wahayshi, for jihadists to conduct simple attacks against a variety of targets in the Muslim world and the West. We also noted how it is relatively simple to conduct such attacks against soft targets using improvised explosive devices, guns or even knives and clubs.
        
        The next day, a lone gunman, U.S. Army Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan (pictured) , opened fire on a group of soldiers at Fort Hood, Texas.
        
        The victims were in the Soldier Readiness Processing Center, a facility on the base where troops are prepared for deployment and where they take care of certain processing tasks such as completing insurance paperwork and receiving medical examinations and vaccinations.
        
        Even though the targets of Hasan's attack were soldiers, they represented a very soft target in this environment. Most soldiers on bases inside the United States are normally not armed and are only provided weapons for training.
        
        The only personnel who regularly carry weapons are the military police and the base civilian police officers.
        
        In addition to being unarmed, the soldiers at the center were closely packed together in the facility as they waited to proceed from station to station. The unarmed, densely packed mass of people allowed Hasan to kill 13 (12 soldiers and one civilian employee of the center) and wound 42 others when he opened fire.
        
        Hasan is a U.S.-born Muslim who, according to STRATFOR sources and media accounts, has had past contact with jihadists, including the radical Imam Anwar al-Awlaki. Al-Awlaki is a U.S.-born imam who espouses a jihadist ideology and who was discussed at some length in the 9/11 commission report for his links to 9/11 hijackers Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi.
        
        Al-Awlaki, who is currently living in Yemen and reportedly has contacts with al Qaeda, posted a message on his Web site Nov. 9 praising Hasan's actions. Despite Hasan's connections to al-Awlaki and other jihadists, it is unknown at this point if he was even aware of al-Wahayshi's recent message calling for simple attacks, and therefore it is impossible to tell if his attack was in response to it.
        
        However, one thing that is certain is that investigators examining Hasan's computer hard drive, e-mail traffic and Internet history will be looking into that possibility, along with other indications that Hasan was linked to radicals.
        
        We noted last week that by their very nature, individual actors and small cells are very difficult for the government to detect. They must somehow identify themselves by contacting a government informant or another person who reports them to the authorities, attend a militant training camp or conduct correspondence with a person or organization under government scrutiny.
        
        In the Hasan case, it now appears that Hasan did self-identify by making radical statements to people he worked with, who reported him to the authorities. It also appears that he had correspondence with people such as al-Awlaki, whom the government was monitoring. Because of this behaviour, Hasan brought himself to the attention of the Department of Defense, the FBI and the CIA.
        
        The fact that Hasan was able to commit this attack after bringing government attention to himself could be due to a number of factors. Chief among them is the fact that it is tactically impossible for a government to identify every aspiring militant actor and to pre-empt every act of violence.
        
        The degree of difficulty is increased greatly if an actor does indeed act alone and does not give any overt clues through his actions or his communications of his intent to attack. Because of this, the Hasan case provides an excellent opportunity to examine national security investigations and their utility and limitations.
        
        The Nature of Intelligence Investigations
        
        The FBI will typically open up an intelligence investigation (usually referred to as a national security investigation) in any case where there is an indication or allegation that a person is involved in terrorist activity but there is no evidence that a specific law has been broken.
        
        Many times these investigations are opened up due to a lead passed by the CIA, National Security Agency or a foreign liaison intelligence service. Other times an FBI investigation can come as a spin-off from another FBI counterterrorism investigation already under way or be prompted by a piece of information collected by an FBI informant or even by a tip from a concerned citizen - like the flight instructors who alerted the FBI to the suspicious behaviour of some foreign flight students prior to the 9/11 attacks.
        
        In such a case, the FBI case agent in charge of the investigation will open a preliminary inquiry, which gives the agent a limited window of time to look into the matter. If no indication of criminal activity is found, the preliminary inquiry must be closed unless the agent receives authorisation from the special agent in charge of his division and FBI headquarters to extend it.
        
        If, during the preliminary inquiry, the investigating agents find probable cause that a crime has been committed, the FBI will open a full-fledged criminal investigation into the case, similar to what we saw in the case of Luqman Ameen Abdullah and his followers in Detroit.
        
        One of the large problems in national security investigations is separating the wheat from the chaff.
        
        Many leads are based on erroneous information or a misidentification of the suspect - there is a huge issue associated with the confusion caused by the transliteration of Arabic names and the fact that there are many people bearing the same names.
        
        Jihadists also have the tendency to use multiple names and identities. And there are many cases in which people will falsely report a person to the FBI out of malice.
        
        Because of these factors, national security investigations proceed slowly and usually do not involve much (if any) contact with the suspect and his close associates. If the suspect is a real militant planning a terrorist attack, investigators do not want to tip him off, and if he is innocent, they do not want to sully his reputation by showing up and overtly interviewing everyone he knows.
        
        Due to its controversial history of domestic intelligence activities, the FBI has become acutely aware of its responsibility to protect privacy rights and civil liberties guaranteed by the Constitution and other laws.
        
        And the rights guaranteed under the Constitution do complicate these national security investigations. It is not illegal for someone to say that Muslims should attack U.S. troops due to their operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, or that more Muslims should conduct attacks like the June 1 shooting at a recruiting center in Little Rock, Ark. - things that Hasan is reported to have said.
        
        Radical statements and convictions are not illegal - although they certainly would appear to be conduct unbecoming a U.S. Army officer. (We will leave to others the discussion of the difficulties in dealing with problem officers who are minorities and doctors and who owe several years of service in return for their education.)
        
        There are also many officers and enlisted soldiers in the U.S. Army who own personal weapons and who use them for self-defence, target shooting or hunting. There is nothing extraordinary or illegal about a U.S. Army major owning personal weapons. With no articulable violation of U.S. law, the FBI would have very little to act upon in a case like Hasan's.
        
        Instead, even if they found cause to extend their preliminary inquiry, they would be pretty much limited to monitoring his activities (and perhaps his communications, with a court order) and waiting for a law to be violated.
        
        In the Hasan case, it would appear that the FBI did not find probable cause that a law had been violated before he opened fire at Fort Hood. Although perhaps if the FBI had been watching his activities closely and with an eye toward "the how" of terrorist attacks, they might have noticed him conducting preoperational surveillance of the readiness center and even a dry run of the attack.
        
        Of course, in addition to just looking for violations of the law, the other main thrust of a national security investigation is to determine whom the suspect is connected to and whom he is talking to or planning with.
        
        In past cases, such investigations have uncovered networks of jihadist actors working together in the United States, Canada, Europe and elsewhere. However, if all Hasan did in his correspondence with people such as al-Awlaki was exercise his First Amendment right to hold radical convictions, and if he did not engage in any type of conspiracy to conduct an attack, he did not break the law.
        
        Another issue that complicates national security cases is that they are almost always classified at the secret level or above. This is understandable, considering they are often opened based upon intelligence produced by sensitive intelligence programmes. However, this classification means that only those people with the proper clearance and an established need to know can be briefed on the case.
        
        It is not at all unusual for the FBI to visit a high-ranking official at another agency to brief the official on the fact that the FBI is conducting a classified national security investigation involving a person working for the official's agency.
        
        The rub is that they will frequently tell the official that he or she is not at liberty to share details of the investigation with other individuals in the agency because they do not have a clear need to know.
        
        The FBI agent will also usually ask the person briefed not to take any action against the target of the investigation, so that the investigation is not compromised. While some people will disagree with the FBI's determination of who really needs to know about the investigation and go on to brief a wider audience, many officials are cowed by the FBI and sit on the information.
        
        Of course, the size of an organization is also a factor in the dissemination of information. The Department of Defense and the U.S. Army are large organizations, and it is possible that officials at the Pentagon or the Army's Criminal Investigation Command (still known by its old acronym CID) headquarters at Fort Belvoir, Va., were briefed on the case and that local officials at Fort Hood were not.
        
        The Associated Press is now reporting that the FBI had alerted a Defense Criminal Investigative Service agent assigned to the Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) in Washington about Hasan's contacts with al-Awlaki, and ABC reports that the Defense Department is denying the FBI notified them.
        
        It would appear that the finger-pointing and bureaucratic blame-shifting normally associated with such cases has begun.
        
        Even more severe problems would have plagued the dissemination of information from the CIA to local commanders and CID officers at Fort Hood. Despite the intelligence reforms put in place after the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. government still faces large obstacles when it comes to sharing intelligence information with law enforcement personnel.
        
        Criminal Acts vs. Terrorism
        
        So far, the Hasan shooting investigation is being run by the Army CID, and the FBI has been noticeably - and uncharacteristically - absent from the scene. As the premier law enforcement agency in the United States, the FBI will often assume authority over investigations where there is even a hint of terrorism.
        
        Since 9/11, the number of FBI/JTTF offices across the country has been dramatically increased, and the JTTFs are specifically charged with investigating cases that may involve terrorism. Therefore, we find the FBI's absence in this case to be quite out of the ordinary.
        
        However, with Hasan being a member of the armed forces, the victims being soldiers or army civilian employees and the incident occurring at Fort Hood, the case would seem to fall squarely under the mantle of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).
        
        From a prosecutorial perspective, a homicide trial under the UCMJ should be very tidy and could be quickly concluded. It will not involve all the potential loose ends that could pop up in a federal terrorism trial, especially when those loose ends involve what the FBI and CIA knew about Hasan, when they learned it and who they told.
        
        Also, politically, there are some who would like to see the Hasan case remain a criminal matter rather than a case of terrorism. Following the shooting death of Luqman Ameen Abdullah and considering the delicate relationship between Muslim advocacy groups and the U.S. government, some people would rather see Hasan portrayed as a mentally disturbed criminal than as an ideologically driven lone wolf.
        
        Despite the CID taking the lead in prosecuting the case, the classified national security investigation by the CIA and FBI into Hasan and his possible connections to jihadist elements is undoubtedly continuing. Senior members of the government will certainly demand to know if Hasan had any confederates, if he was part of a bigger plot and if there are more attacks to come.
        
        Several congressmen and senators are also calling for hearings into the case, and if such hearings occur, they will certainly produce an abundance of interesting information pertaining to Hasan and the national security investigation of his activities.

    textlede: Counterterrorism: Shifting from 'Who' to 'How'
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        HIGHLIGHT: In the 11th edition of the online magazine Sada al-Malahim (The Echo of Battle), which was released to jihadist Web sites last week, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) leader Nasir al-Wahayshi wrote an article that called for jihadists to conduct simple attacks against a variety of targets.
        
        The targets included "any tyrant, intelligence den, prince" or "minister" (referring to the governments in the Muslim world like Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Yemen), and "any crusaders whenever you find one of them, like at the airports of the crusader Western countries that participate in the wars against Islam, or their living compounds, trains etc.," (an obvious reference to the United States and Europe and Westerners living in Muslim countries).
        
        Al-Wahayshi, an ethnic Yemeni who spent time in Afghanistan serving as a lieutenant under Osama bin Laden, noted these simple attacks could be conducted with readily available weapons such as knives, clubs or small improvised explosive devices (IEDs).
        
        According to al-Wahayshi, jihadists "don't need to conduct a big effort or spend a lot of money to manufacture 10 grams of explosive material" and that they should not "waste a long time finding the materials, because you can find all these in your mother's kitchen, or readily at hand or in any city you are in."
        
        That al-Wahayshi gave these instructions in an Internet magazine distributed via jihadist chat rooms, not in some secret meeting with his operational staff, demonstrates that they are clearly intended to reach grassroots jihadists -- and are not intended as some sort of internal guidance for AQAP members.
        
        In fact, al-Wahayshi was encouraging grassroots jihadists to "do what Abu al-Khair did" referring to AQAP member Abdullah Hassan Taleh al-Asiri, the Saudi suicide bomber who attempted to kill Saudi Deputy Interior Minister Prince Mohammed bin Nayef with a small IED on August 28.
        
        The most concerning aspect of al-Wahayshi's statement is that it is largely true. Improvised explosive mixtures are in fact relatively easy to make from readily available chemicals -- if a person has the proper training -- and attacks using small IEDs or other readily attainable weapons such as knives or clubs (or firearms in the United States) are indeed quite simple to conduct.
        
        As STRATFOR has noted for several years now, with al Qaeda's structure under continual attack and no regional al Qaeda franchise groups in the Western Hemisphere, the most pressing jihadist threat to the US homeland at present stems from grassroots jihadists, not the al Qaeda core.
        
        This trend has been borne out by the large number of plots and arrests over the past several years, to include several so far in 2009. The grassroots have likewise proven to pose a critical threat to Europe (although it is important to note that the threat posed by grassroots operatives is more widespread, but normally involves smaller, less strategic attacks than those conducted by the al Qaeda core).
        
        From a counterterrorism perspective, the problem posed by grassroots operatives is that unless they somehow self-identify by contacting a government informant or another person who reports them to authorities, attend a militant training camp, or conduct electronic correspondence with a person or organization under government scrutiny, they are very difficult to detect.
        
        The threat posed by grassroots operatives, and the difficulty identifying them, highlight the need for counterterrorism programs to adopt a proactive, protective intelligence approach to the problem -- an approach that focuses on "the how" of militant attacks instead of just "the who."
        
        The How
        
        In the traditional, reactive approach to counterterrorism, where authorities respond to a crime scene after a terrorist attack to find and arrest the militants responsible for the attack, it is customary to focus on the who, or on the individual or group behind the attack.
        
        Indeed, in this approach, the only time much emphasis is placed on the how is either in an effort to identify a suspect when an unknown actor carried out the attack, or to prove that a particular suspect was responsible for the attack during a trial. Beyond these limited purposes, not much attention is paid to the how.
        
        In large part, this focus on the who is a legacy of the fact that for many years, the primary philosophy of the US government was to treat counterterrorism as a law-enforcement program, with a focus on prosecution rather than on disrupting plots.
        
        Certainly, catching and prosecuting those who commit terrorist attacks is necessary, but from our perspective, preventing attacks is more important, and prevention requires a proactive approach. To pursue such a proactive approach to counterterrorism, the how becomes a critical question.
        
        By studying and understanding how attacks are conducted -- i.e., the exact steps and actions required for a successful attack -- authorities can establish systems to proactively identify early indicators that planning for an attack is under way.
        
        People involved in planning the attack can then be focused on, identified, and action can be taken prevent them from conducting the attack or attacks they are plotting. This means that focusing on the how can lead to previously unidentified suspects, e.g., those who do not self-identify.
        
        "How was the attack conducted?" is the primary question addressed by protective intelligence, which is, at its core, a process for proactively identifying and assessing potential threats. Focusing on the how, then, requires protective intelligence practitioners to carefully study the tactics, tradecraft and behavior associated with militant actors involved in terrorist attacks.
        
        This allows them to search for and identify those behaviors before an attack takes place. Many of these behaviors are not by themselves criminal in nature; visiting a public building and observing security measures or standing on the street to watch the arrival of a VIP at their office are not illegal, but they can be indicators that an attack is being plotted.
        
        Such legal activities ultimately could be overt actions in furtherance of an illegal conspiracy to conduct the attack, but even where conspiracy cannot be proved, steps can still be taken to identify possible assailants and prevent a potential attack -- or at the very least, to mitigate the risk posed by the people involved.
        
        Protective intelligence is based on the fact that successful attacks don't just happen out of the blue.
        
        Rather, terrorist attacks follow a discernable attack cycle. There are critical points during that cycle where a plot is most likely to be detected by an outside observer.
        
        Some of the points during the attack cycle when potential attackers are most vulnerable to detection are while surveillance is being conducted and weapons are being acquired. However, there are other, less obvious points where people on the lookout can spot preparations for an attack.
        
        It is true that sometimes individuals do conduct ill-conceived, poorly executed attacks that involve shortcuts in the planning process. But this type of spur-of-the-moment attack is usually associated with mentally disturbed individuals and it is extremely rare for a militant actor to conduct a spontaneous terrorist attack without first following the steps of the attack cycle.
        
        To really understand the how, protective intelligence practitioners cannot simply acknowledge that something like surveillance occurs.
        
        Rather, they must turn a powerful lens on steps like preoperational surveillance to gain an in-depth understanding of them. Dissecting an activity like preoperational surveillance requires not only examining subjects such as the demeanor demonstrated by those conducting surveillance prior to an attack and the specific methods and cover for action and status used.
        
        It also requires identifying particular times where surveillance is most likely and certain optimal vantage points (called perches in surveillance jargon) from where a surveillant is most likely to operate when seeking to surveil a specific facility or event. This type of complex understanding of surveillance can then be used to help focus human or technological countersurveillance efforts where they can be most effective.
        
        Unfortunately, many counterterrorism investigators are so focused on the who that they do not focus on collecting this type of granular how information.
        
        When we have spoken with law enforcement officers responsible for investigating recent grassroots plots, they gave us blank stares in response to questions about how the suspects had conducted surveillance on the intended targets.
        
        They simply had not paid attention to this type of detail -- but this oversight is not really the investigators' fault. No one had ever explained to them why paying attention to, and recording, this type of detail was important.
        
        Moreover, it takes specific training and a practiced eye to observe and record these details without glossing over them. For example, it is quite useful if a protective intelligence officer has first conducted a lot of surveillance, because conducting surveillance allows one to understand what a surveillant must do and where he must be in order to effectively observe surveillance of a specific person or place.
        
        Similarly, to truly understand the tradecraft required to build an IED and the specific steps a militant needs to complete to do so, it helps to go to an IED school where the investigator learns the tradecraft firsthand.
        
        Militant actors can and do change over time. New groups, causes and ideologies emerge, and specific militants can be killed, captured or retire. But the tactical steps a militant must complete to conduct a successful attack are constant.
        
        It doesn't matter if the person planning an attack is a radical environmentalist, a grassroots jihadist or a member of the al Qaeda core, for while these diverse actors will exhibit different levels of professionalism in regard to terrorist tradecraft, they still must follow essentially the same steps, accomplish the same tasks and operate in the same areas. Knowing this allows protective intelligence to guard against different levels of threats.
        
        Of course, tactics can be changed and perfected and new tactics can be developed (often in response to changes in security and law enforcement operations). Additionally, new technologies can emerge (like cell phones and Google Earth) -- which can alter the way some of these activities are conducted, or reduce the time it takes to complete them.
        
        Studying the tradecraft and behaviors needed to execute evolving tactics, however, allows protective intelligence practitioners to respond to such changes and even alter how they operate in order to more effectively search for potential hostile activity.
        
        Technology does not only aid those seeking to conduct attacks. There are a variety of new tools, such as Trapwire, a software system designed to work with camera systems to help detect patterns of preoperational surveillance, that can be focused on critical areas to help cut through the fog of noise and activity and draw attention to potential threats.
        
        These technological tools can help turn the tables on unknown plotters because they are designed to focus on the how. They will likely never replace human observation and experience, but they can serve as valuable aids to human perception.
        
        Of course, protective intelligence does not have to be the sole responsibility of federal authorities specifically charged with counterterrorism. Corporate security managers and private security contractors should also apply these principles to protecting the people and facilities in their charge, as should local and state police agencies. I
        
        n a world full of soft targets -- and limited resources to protect those targets from attack -- the more eyes looking for such activity the better. Even the general public has an important role to play in practicing situational awareness and spotting potential terrorist activity.
        
        Keeping it Simple?
        
        Al-Wahayshi is right that it is not difficult to construct improvised explosives from a wide range of household chemicals like peroxide and acetone or chlorine and brake fluid. He is also correct that some of those explosive mixtures can be concealed in objects ranging from electronic items to picture frames, or can be employed in forms ranging from hand grenades to suicide vests. Likewise, low-level attacks can also be conducted using knives, clubs and guns.
        
        Furthermore, when grassroots jihadists plan and carry out attacks acting as lone wolves or in small compartmentalized cells without inadvertently betraying their mission by conspiring with people known to the authorities, they are not able to be detected by the who-focused systems, and it becomes far more difficult to discover and thwart these plots.
        
        This focus on the how absolutely does not mean that who-centered programs must be abandoned. Surveillance on known militants, their associates and communications should continue, efforts to identify people attending militant training camps or fighting in places like Afghanistan or Somalia must be increased, and people who conduct terrorist attacks should be identified and prosecuted.
        
        However -- and this is an important however -- if an unknown militant is going to conduct even a simple attack against some of the targets al-Wahayshi suggests, such as an airport, train, or specific leader or media personality, complexity creeps into the picture, and the planning cycle must be followed if an attack is going to be successful.
        
        The prospective attacker must observe and quantify the target, construct a plan for the attack and then execute that plan. The demands of this process will force even an attacker previously unknown to the authorities into a position where he is vulnerable to discovery.
        
        If the attacker does this while there are people watching for such activity, he will likely be seen. But if he does this while there are no watchers, there is little chance that he will become a who until after the attack has been completed.

    textlede: Saudi Arabia fears militants use Yemen, new tactics
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        RIYADH: A recent attempt to assassinate Saudi Arabia s security chief has raised concerns over new methods of hiding explosives, as well as al Qaeda using Yemen to revive its operations against Saudi Arabia, experts say. In August, a suicide bomber posing as a repentant militant blew himself up in the Jeddah office of security chief Prince Mohammed bin Nayef in the first known attack on a member of the royal Saudi family since al Qaeda began a campaign in 2003.
        
        Saudi media reports have suggested the bomber, who entered Saudi Arabia from Yemen in a prior arrangement with the prince, hid the device in his anus.
        
        "This is indeed a new strategy ... to hide explosives inside the body, inside sensitive parts," said Sheikh Mohammad al-Najimi, professor at King Fahd Security College which trains thousands of police officers every year in counter-terrorism.
        
        "I think they will try it again," he said. The explosion was probably activated by mobile phone, diplomats and experts say. It caused heavy damage to the room and even such small quantities could be lethal if used in a plane. Regular airport procedures do not involve such body checks or use of sensors that would detect that kind of explosive.
        
        "This is an international problem, not just for Saudi Arabia and the Gulf," said Mustafa Alani, a security analyst in Dubai. Diplomats said security at the diplomatic quarter in Riyadh and other sensitive points had been increased in the days after the attack but since then no visible changes could be seen. Stability in the world s biggest oil exporting region is of global concern as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are key OPEC members and major dollar asset holders. The incident confirmed Saudi fears that Yemen has become a new centre for al Qaeda, where many Saudis on a list of 85 wanted suspect militants are thought to be. An insurgency in the north and separatist unrest in the south has created instability that al Qaeda can exploit, Saudi officials fear.
        
        "There seems to have been no crackdown on suspects (inside Saudi Arabia) as some might have expected," said a Western diplomat in Riyadh. An interior ministry spokesman told al-Riyadh on Wednesday that investigations were still ongoing. Saudi Arabia managed with the help of foreign experts to halt a campaign of al Qaeda in 2006 after a serious of attacks on foreign residential compounds, government targets and energy installations since 2003. The Yemeni and Saudi branches of al Qaeda merged earlier this year to form the al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).
        
        "Following the merger, al Qaeda has prioritised attacks in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states in an attempt to make itself regionally relevant," said CTC Sentinel, a U.S.-based publication that researches militant affairs. Gulf states hope that a border fence Saudi is building can end infiltration, especially from the over 1,500 kilometer long, mountanous border with Yemen, the poorest country in the region. In July, Saudi Arabia awarded European firm EADS a $2.3 billion deal to build a fence with command posts, cameras and sensors accompanied by coastal and air surveillance. Analysts say that while it was a good idea, the Saudi fence project will not immediately end a tradition of smuggling everything from weapons to pilgrims through the porous border with Yemen. For one, it would take years to be ready.
        
        "Al Qaeda will probably try to find a way around it," said Theodore Karasik at the Institute for Near East & Gulf Military Analysis, adding that sea surveillance was also crucial. CTC said al Qaeda is trying to forge alliances with Yemeni tribes through marriages. Diplomats say Crown Prince Sultan s absence from the country for almost a year due to illness has harmed security policy since he was a key figure organisating Yemeni policy.
        
        "Saudi Arabia is helping Yemen much with intelligence but Sultan used to be the main contact for Yemeni tribes and other main players," said another Western diplomat.

    textlede: Where extremists come to play; Yemen is the perfect breeding ground for terrorists. Could Obama really return Guantanamo prisoners here?
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        In a country where weapons outnumber people, half the population is illiterate, close to a quarter can't find work, and internecine fighting is forcing thousands from their homes, the extremists come to play.
        
        It is here that terrorists attacked the USS Cole in 2000, where Al Qaeda suspects dug their way out of a downtown prison to escape in 2006, and where suicide bombers attacked the U.S. embassy last fall.
        
        It is also where nearly 100 Yemen-born Guantanamo prisoners could return. The Pentagon claims some of them are too dangerous to release but cannot be prosecuted because of insufficient or tainted evidence. For the innocent who were wrongly detained, there is fear that years in custody could have nurtured a deadly grudge, making them prime Al Qaeda recruits.
        
        The question of what to do with Yemeni detainees has plagued the U.S. administration.
        
        With only four months until U.S. President Barack Obama's January deadline to close Guantanamo's prison, the Star travelled here to investigate Washington's dilemma, interviewing former Guantanamo prisoners, Al Qaeda members, government ministers, analysts, academics, lawyers and diplomats.
        
        Most days, the rhythm of Sana'a is quaint: the morning call to prayer; the Old City market yawning awake as shopkeepers sip cups of coffee from recycled tin cans, the city screaming to life when the caffeine hits. Then things slow again in the lazy afternoon as most men - and sometimes women - sit in groups, chewing huge wads of the ubiquitous leafy narcotic khat.
        
        More sinister is what lies beneath: conditions for a terrorist movement to grow and thrive. The government is overwhelmed with myriad crushing social and security problems. Already the poorest country in the Arab world, Yemen faces dwindling water and oil reserves.
        
        Throw in the fact Yemen is a magnet for Al Qaeda wannabes or has-beens and some days it feels like you've walked into the famous Star Wars bar, Chalmun's Cantina, where drunken pilots mingle and fight with alien wise guys as everyone else looks blithely on.
        
        The government continues to demand repatriation of the Guantanamo detainees, but little has been done to guarantee either human rights for the innocent or public safety from those who aren't.
        
        In January, President Ali Abdullah Saleh promised a rehabilitation centre for the returnees within three months. But while visiting Yemen recently, the Star discovered that nothing has been done.
        
        And with the terms "the next Afghanistan" and "powder keg" tossed about Washington concerning Yemen, the Obama administration is reluctant to repatriate the Guantanamo detainees without a rehab program.
        
        How can Obama return these men?
        
        How can he not?
        
        YEMEN WAS ONCE a leader in the niche field of rehabilitation for suspected terrorists, establishing the first post-9/11 program.
        
        Hamoud al Hitar was in charge of the program, called the Committee for Religious Dialogue, which, by his own admission, primarily involved talking. The goal was to lure jailed militants away from violence by engaging them in what al Hitar calls "theological duels."
        
        Hundreds underwent this jailhouse counselling, in which a rotation of Islamic high court judges including al Hitar would demonstrate that violence in the name of religion was not permissible. Some were group sessions, others private, but each prisoner's program normally lasted just a few days.
        
        Lack of political will, as well as funding, killed the program in 2005.
        
        Today, al Hitar is the minister of Religious Endowments in the Yemeni government. He leans back in his chair, dressed traditionally in a flowing white thawb, with a curved dagger secured in an embroidered sash that matches his pillbox cap. He quells reports of another program in the works.
        
        "There is no program now," he says.
        
        There is a slight defensiveness in his voice as he peers over his gold-rimmed glasses and says of his counselling: "It was 98 per cent successful."
        
        But an article in the CTC Sentinel, a terrorism-focused publication out of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, concludes that al Hitar's program "now appears to be a failure."
        
        The report states that 364 men participated in that program and were released, receiving almost no support or follow-up. Some graduates reportedly disappeared, while others were killed in Iraq.
        
        One of the shortcomings, the article notes, is that the program focused on convincing prisoners that Yemen was an Islamic state with Saleh as its rightful leader, thereby steering them away from violence within Yemen. But not necessarily outside.
        
        And some of the graduates are suspected of orchestrating last September's embassy bombing here - the only direct hit on an American target since 9/11, barring wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
        
        Al Hitar says he is tired of the criticism. And he asks what the U.S. has done to try to rehabilitate the prisoners. Guantanamo has only spawned more terrorism, he argues, adding, "violations create violations and peace creates peace."
        
        NASSER AL BAHRI was one of the first graduates of Yemen's now-defunct rehabilitation program, personally counselled by al Hitar.
        
        Al Bahri was also once Osama bin Laden's chief bodyguard. For four years, his job was to walk a few steps ahead of the leader, ready to take a bullet or absorb the first impact of a bomb. In Afghanistan, al Bahri was known by the nickname "Abu Jandal," which translates roughly as "The Powerful One."
        
        Now 37 and a father of four, al Bahri lives in Saawan, a dusty, rundown Sana'a neighbourhood adjacent to the U.S. Embassy, where cars navigate concrete barriers blocking the streets. Since the embassy bombing there's a bunker-like feel to the area.
        
        On the summer afternoon the Star picks him up for an interview, al Bahri is waiting on a street corner near his house, dressed in khakis and a polo shirt, looking like a business executive waiting for a golf game.
        
        En route to a small, breezy courtyard in the Old City, one of the few places where foreigners with video cameras do not draw attention, al Bahri flashes a beatific smile, revealing his impressively white teeth. His cologne fills the car.
        
        Saudi Arabian-born to Yemeni parents, al Bahri was raised in a middle-class family and seduced by stories of jihad during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. He left home in 1994 to fight in Bosnia, Somalia and then Afghanistan, where he met bin Laden. After three days of listening to bin Laden speak about the American oppression of Muslims, he pledged his allegiance and began his move up Al Qaeda's ranks.
        
        He says his life as an Al Qaeda soldier ended in 2000 with the bombing of the USS Cole. Although he contends he was merely visiting Yemen at the time and did not know about the attacks, he was among those quickly arrested and thrown into political prisons without access to lawyers or trials.
        
        When an FBI agent later travelled to Yemen to investigate the 9/11 attacks, the full extent of al Bahri's high-level Al Qaeda connections were revealed.
        
        FBI agent Ali Soufan - whose patient and persistent interrogation in 2001 included bringing the diabetic al Bahri some sugar-free cookies - testified about al Bahri's questioning before a U.S. Senate committee earlier this year: "Through our interrogation, which was done completely by the book, including advising him of his rights, we obtained a treasure trove of highly significant actionable intelligence.
        
        "Abu Jandal," Soufan said, using al Bahri's nom de guerre, "gave us extensive information on Osama bin Laden's terror network, structure, leadership, membership, security details, facilities, family, communication methods, travels, training, ammunitions and weaponry, including a breakdown of what machine guns, rifles, rocket launchers and anti-tank missiles they used. He also provided explicit details of the 9/11 plot operatives, and identified many terrorists who we later successfully apprehended."
        
        Fast forward to today.
        
        The man sitting in the front seat of our car is charming and seems unfazed by the attention. In the seven years since his release from detention, al Bahri has gone to school to become a business administrator. He is helping raise his young children and writing a memoir with the aid of a French journalist. During four hours of interviews, he apologizes profusely for the fact that his diabetes means frequent trips to the washroom.
        
        There's no indication al Bahri has maintained ties to the organization to which he once pledged his life (though he is likely still watched, he has never been re-arrested).
        
        But does he still support Al Qaeda? Al Bahri's answer is complicated.
        
        "People are categorized, some people say that I am a member and others say I am a supporter. I am a supporter today of Al Qaeda, not a member.
        
        "The difference between a member and a supporter is that a member has the capability to execute, but I support. As supporters, we back whatever Al Qaeda does against the U.S."
        
        His take on bin Laden? "Osama bin laden is very normal person ... your average father or friend or husband. He treated us like he was our older brother and we his younger siblings. He is a man that believes he has a righteous cause. So he defends his cause with all the means available."
        
        On Al Qaeda? Al Bahri believes it is now a worldwide brand and young new recruits often have no clue of what they're fighting for.
        
        "These groups have their own platforms and goals and foundations, but you can say they jumped on the bandwagon while they use their old strategies and tactics in fighting local regimes."
        
        On targeting civilians? He is opposed.
        
        But on 9/11? "Ordinary Americans don't know what the U.S. is doing abroad; they need to feel the suffering that other peoples are going through. Bin Laden didn't target the civilians in September. He simply hit targets and civilians happened to be around."
        
        In rehabilitation parlance, al Bahri could arguably be said to have "disengaged," but not to have been "deradicalized."
        
        Experts say disengagement means a change in behaviour; deradicalization is a change in beliefs.
        
        Al Bahri underwent three counselling sessions in jail with al Hitar, talking about religion and militancy. But the fact they met in prison, under the watchful eyes of the country's political security force, tainted the process, al Bahri said.
        
        He considers himself lucky because he has family and an education, and found the will for a different life. That's why he is no longer a fighter, he declares, not because the program worked for him.
        
        On the last day of his meeting with al Hitar, the former bodyguard was given papers to sign promising good behaviour. Al Bahri said he'd have signed anything just to get out.
        
        As Yemen's rehab program sputtered, Saudi Arabia's was just getting started. Faced with thousands of its own jailed jihadists, and recognizing that 15 of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers were Saudis, the government created its own program.
        
        The Saudis had funds the Yemeni government didn't and invested heavily. They adopted a holistic approach that not only provided counselling but also lavished prisoners with cars and jobs, and even helped them find wives and financed weddings.
        
        Religious dialogue was part of the curriculum but not its focus. The idea was to treat prisoners not as religious zealots but men in need of a second chance, to provide a better future than the one Al Qaeda offered. Financial and emotional support continued after rehab - and a false step meant the end of benefits.
        
        It was "soft" rehabilitation in a country not known for leniency.
        
        The program quickly received international acclaim, praised by both the former Bush and British governments and touted in the foreign press. More than 100 Saudi prisoners have been released from Guantanamo into this program, despite the fact the Pentagon accused many of high-level Al Qaeda connections - allegations more serious than those facing many of the remaining Yemeni detainees.
        
        Christopher Boucek, an associate at Washington's Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and author of the Sentinel report on rehabilitation, notes that in Saudi Arabia, "one of the things they learned early on is that they need to support people and people's families, because if they don't someone else will."
        
        Boucek said wives of detained militants have reported getting cash-stuffed envelopes from Al Qaeda slipped under the doors with notes saying, "We're going to take care of you while your husband is away."
        
        "Either the government can do it, or it is going to be extremists," says Boucek.
        
        One option Obama has pursued is to simply send the Guantanamo Yemenis to the Saudi program.
        
        But in an interview with Al Jazeera this week, Yemeni President Saleh said those talks have stalled. The Saudis, he said, didn't want the prisoners.
        
        Analysts say the Saudi solution was more of a political option than a practical one - just finding somewhere for the Yemenis to go but without any real chances of helping them reintegrate.
        
        "The key in Saudi Arabia and other places where these programs work is that they're not just focused on an individual but their entire social network," says Boucek.
        
        "If the Yemenis go through this program and get sent back to Yemen, what leverage do the Saudis have to pull them back?"
        
        Even for the Saudi prisoners, while the recidivism rates appear low, there have been some high-profile exceptions.
        
        Earlier this year, Al Qaeda forces in Yemen and Saudi Arabia merged to form a new group called Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP.
        
        The Web-savvy and seemingly organized group is quickly gaining the attention of intelligence services worldwide.
        
        The deputy commander is Ali al Shihri - a former Guantanamo detainee and a graduate of the Saudi program. Al Shihri appeared on an online video in January claiming, "Imprisonment made us more determined in our conviction."
        
        ONLY 14 Yemeni detainees have been sent back home since the Guantanamo prison camp, Cuba, opened more than seven years ago. The bodies of two more have been returned to their families - alleged suicides in Guantanamo.
        
        The 14th detainee, Salim Ahmed Hamdan, is perhaps Guantanamo's most famous.
        
        In 2006, Hamdan won a Supreme Court challenge against the U.S. administration: the landmark ruling concluded Guantanamo was not beyond the reach of the U.S. courts.
        
        It's ironic that Hamdan is now free here, given that he was one of the Pentagon's marquee cases, tried and convicted of supporting terrorism. He was bin Laden's chauffeur and also happens to be al Bahri's brother-in-law.
        
        Al Bahri recruited Hamdan when he was a poor, uneducated taxi driver and helped get him to Afghanistan, where he worked as bin Laden's driver for $200 a month. Years later, Hamdan and al Bahri married Yemeni sisters.
        
        A Guantanamo military panel sentenced Hamdan to just five months, accepting his lawyer's defence that he was a mere foot soldier and giving him credit for time in U.S. custody. He returned here last November to serve the last two months of his sentence.
        
        Hamdan spoke with the Star in his only interview since being captured by U.S. forces in Afghanistan in 2001. He lives now with his wife and two daughters and tries to make enough money driving a taxi to keep a small home near the downtown core.
        
        "I want to forget those seven years," he says of Guantanamo. As for his return, "It is really hard to adjust and there was no help here."
        
        None of the other 13 released men received much support either - coming back to loved ones who have become accustomed to their absence, no jobs, and the enormous stigma of being from Gitmo. They were all released under the Bush administration after having been designated "no longer an enemy combatant."
        
        That means they were no longer considered a threat or, in some cases, there was no evidence showing a connection to terrorism in the first place.
        
        Some were put in custody immediately upon their return to Yemen. Three of those former prisoners also agreed to talk to the Star, meeting for an afternoon at a hotel lounge. They said it was the first time they had been together since Guantanamo.
        
        Saleh al Zuba says he's 60, "maybe more," and his weathered face and occasional laboured breathing do make him appear older. He's now a pipefitter and handyman, but work is hard to find. Occasionally stroking his hennaed beard, al Zuba talks in a low, raspy voice about his five-year detention.
        
        As with most Guantanamo prisoners, there are two distinct narratives for al Zuba's life: his story and the Pentagon's.
        
        The U.S. version is contained in a two-page document presented at his administrative review hearing in Guantanamo. It claims al Zuba was an Al Qaeda member who admitted to training in Afghanistan and has a "history of non-compliance," in detention.
        
        Al Zuba claims that his only connection with Afghanistan was to ask for help from an Afghan charity to have an angioplasty in Pakistan. He also says that during interrogations at Gitmo, "they spared no method of torture or humiliation in dealing with us."
        
        Al Zuba says he spent time with many of the Yemeni detainees still in Guantanamo before his December 2006 return, and he argues on behalf of those he believes are wrongly imprisoned in there - Yemeni teachers, students and charity workers.
        
        "The longer these people stay in detention, the more complicated their mental state is and the state of their relatives. And this definitely will lead to negative consequences. So why don't they address this issue in the proper way so that the person can return to his country safely and not be a threat?"
        
        BESIDE AL ZUBA sits another former five-year prisoner, Mohsen al Askari. He came back two years ago, is not married and, at 28, still depends still on his father for financial support while he trains to become an electrician.
        
        Askari was interrogated for three years before he attended his administrative review hearing in Guantanamo. He told the military panel that he had gone to Afghanistan to help fight with the Taliban, to form a "true Muslim state."
        
        But he rejected accusations that he was part of the fight against the U.S., insisting that he had fled to Pakistan, looking for a way back to Yemen after 9/11. He was picked up by Pakistani forces and eventually handed over to the United States.
        
        "The detainee described Al Qaeda and anyone associated with Osama bin Laden as 'criminals' and blames them for his current predicament," a transcript of the hearing states.
        
        "He 'hated' Afghanistan and curses the day he set foot in Afghanistan."
        
        He told the U.S. military panel he would take a polygraph if needed to testify that his only knowledge about Al Qaeda came through watching Al Jazeera. Askari says he returned to Yemen from Guantanamo an angry man.
        
        "In Yemen, it's hard for anybody to get a job. But it's much harder when you're a Guantanamo Bay detainee."
        
        Fellow former detainee Walid al Qadasi has faced similar challenges. He says his wife has just left him and he can't find a job. Any job. He says he doesn't care what he does.
        
        The first Yemeni to be returned, he arrived back from Guantanamo in April 2004. (He was captured in Iran, where he says he was looking for work, and then "sold" to the Americans three months later. The U.S. claimed he was connected to Al Qaeda).
        
        Upon his return he was held here for another two years, first in a prison in his hometown of Tai'z and then in Sana'a. Amnesty International and lawyers with the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights took up his case, visiting him in prison in 2005 and highlighting the fact that he was still being held without trial.
        
        Now 29 and married, he has two children, the youngest just 10 days old at the time of the Star's interview last month. He depends on his father-in-law for support. Slumping listlessly, he answers most questions in short sentences.
        
        "My wife says she will not return until I get a job," Al Qadasi says.
        
        He shrugs.
        
        "There are no jobs."
        
        The Yemeni detainees, all 100-odd of them, are waiting.
        
        They now represent almost half of the Guantanamo prisoners yet to be charged or released. Initially, Afghan and Saudi prisoners by far outnumbered Yemenis, but the stalemate over the Yemenis' relocation has made them prisoners of their citizenship.
        
        More than 100 Saudi prisoners have been released from Guantanamo despite the fact that the Pentagon accuses many of high-level Al Qaeda connections - allegations more serious than those facing many of the remaining Yemeni detainees.
        
        Yemen began cooperating with the U.S. immediately following the 9/11 attacks, but relations have been troubled. American officials have accused the government of paroling dangerous terrorists and playing a role in the mysterious Al Qaeda prison escape.
        
        Both administrations have used the threat of Al Qaeda for domestic purposes - Yemen to gain international help in quelling civil conflicts, and the U.S. to justify its involvement in the country.
        
        There are some Guantanamo detainees, of course, that the U.S. has no intention of releasing. Yemeni Ramzi bin al Shibh is one of them, accused along with four others of masterminding the 9/11 attacks.
        
        As many as 80 prisoners will face trial in either civilian criminal courts or before military tribunals - but the Pentagon will not say how many are Yemenis.
        
        There's another large group who have already been cleared for transfer by the Pentagon or that the federal courts have ordered released - including three Yemeni detainees who had their cases decided since Obama took power. But they, too, remain behind bars.
        
        The problem prisoners are those who fall between these two categories - those who Washington says are a danger but has insufficient evidence against.
        
        Complicating these cases is the fact that in Yemen, jihad can be a family affair. Several of the Yemeni Guantanamo detainees have family ties to terrorism suspects either wanted or in jail back home. One has a brother who is AQAP's military commander. Others are related to the Al Qaeda suspects who staged the prison outbreak.
        
        But as long as Obama continues to hold the detainees, Guantanamo will continue to loom large as a symbol of U.S. oppression. Obama's efforts to mend the U.S.'s tattered image and distance himself from the Bush administration's policies have had impact here. If he backs down on promises such as closing Gitmo by January, the goodwill he has created here is likely to dissipate.
        
        "We consider that we have begun a new era," said Sheikh Abdul Majeed al Zindani, who spoke to the Star in a rare interview in the VIP lounge of Sana'a International Airport.
        
        "The U.S., under the leadership of Obama, has begun to rectify these aggressive policies against Islam and Muslims that were declared by Bush," continued al Zindani, founder of Al Imam University, Yemen's largest religious school. He is also the head of the consultative council of the conservative Islah Party and listed by the U.S. as a "specially designated global terrorist."
        
        The allegations against him include being bin Laden's spiritual adviser and a recruiter for Al Qaeda - claims he vehemently denies.
        
        "The closing of Guantanamo is a victory of justice and righteousness and it is the duty of the people to bring back their own," he said in Arabic.
        
        "The oppression of one detainee," he added, is the "oppression of the entire nation."
        
        Then he rapped the shins of the Star's translator with his cane. His guards closed in. Time was up.
        
        GREGORY JOHNSEN, a much-vaunted Yemen scholar at Princeton, is here conducting research for an upcoming book about insurgency in the country. He looks as comfortable in Yemen as he does at his New Jersey campus. Whether interviewing a government minister or sitting with jihadists while they chew khat, he wears Birkenstocks and uses not a briefcase but a plastic shopping bag to carry his notes and a water bottle.
        
        Fluent in Arabic and accustomed to local traditions, Johnsen writes a popular blog on Yemen and, more than jihadists or bureaucrats, politicians or humanitarians, best articulates Obama's big decision.
        
        "There are no guarantees that the people you let out aren't going to commit crimes," he says, "but at the same time, you have a number of people who are quite clearly innocent of any crimes that you've been holding in prison for a number of years.
        
        "You can continue to keep these guys and allow Al Qaeda to score rhetorical points and gain more and more recruits as younger and younger people get radicalized ... or you can release them and face the potential of having some of them carry out attacks.
        
        "There are," Johnsen adds, "only bad options now."

    textlede: AQAP: Paradigm Shifts and Lessons Learned
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        HIGHLIGHT: On the evening of Aug. 28, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the Saudi Deputy Interior Minister - and the man in charge of the kingdom's counterterrorism efforts - was receiving members of the public in connection with the celebration of Ramadan, the Islamic month of fasting.
        
        As part of the Ramadan celebration, it is customary for members of the Saudi royal family to hold public gatherings where citizens can seek to settle disputes or offer Ramadan greetings.
        
        One of the highlights of the Friday gathering was supposed to be the prince`s meeting with Abdullah Hassan Taleh al-Asiri, a Saudi man who was a wanted militant from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). Al-Asiri had allegedly renounced terrorism and had requested to meet the prince in order to repent and then be accepted into the kingdom`s amnesty program.
        
        Such surrenders are not unprecedented - and they serve as great press events for the kingdom`s ideological battle against jihadists Prince Mohammed, who is responsible for the Saudi rehabilitation program for militants, is a key figure in that ideological battle.
        
        In February, a man who appeared with al-Asiri on Saudi Arabia`s list of most-wanted militants - former Guantanamo Bay inmate Mohammed al-Awfi - surrendered in Yemen and was transported to Saudi Arabia where he renounced terrorism and entered into the kingdom`s amnesty program. Al-Awfi, who had appeared in a January 2009 video issued by the newly created AQAP after the merger of the Saudi and Yemeni nodes of the global jihadist network, was a senior AQAP leader, and his renouncement was a major blow against AQAP.
        
        But the al-Asiri case ended very differently from the al-Awfi case. Unlike al-Awfi, al-Asiri was not a genuine repentant - he was a human Trojan horse. After al-Asiri entered a small room to speak with Prince Mohammed, he activated a small improvised explosive device (IED) he had been carrying inside his anal cavity. The resulting explosion ripped al-Asiri to shreds but only lightly injured the shocked prince - the target of al-Asiri`s unsuccessful assassination attempt.
        
        While the assassination proved unsuccessful, AQAP had been able to shift the operational paradigm in a manner that allowed them to achieve tactical surprise. The surprise was complete and the Saudis did not see the attack coming - the operation could have succeeded had it been better executed.
        
        The kind of paradigm shift evident in this attack has far-reaching implications from a protective-intelligence standpoint, and security services will have to adapt in order to counter the new tactics employed. The attack also allows some important conclusions to be drawn about AQAP`s ability to operate inside Saudi Arabia.
        
        Paradigm Shifts
        
        Militants conducting terrorist attacks and the security services attempting to guard against such attacks have long engaged in a tactical game of cat and mouse. As militants adopt new tactics, security measures are then implemented to counter those tactics. The security changes then cause the militants to change in response and the cycle begins again. These changes can include using different weapons, employing weapons in a new way or changing the type of targets selected
        
        Sometimes, militants will implement a new tactic or series of tactics that is so revolutionary that it completely changes the framework of assumptions - or the paradigm - under which the security forces operate. Historically, al Qaeda and its jihadist progeny have proved to be very good at understanding the security paradigm and then developing tactics intended to exploit vulnerabilities in that paradigm in order to launch surprise attacks. For example:
        
        · Prior to the 9/11 attacks, it was inconceivable that a large passenger aircraft would be used as a manually operated cruise missile. Hence, security screeners allowed box cutters to be carried onto aircraft, which were then used by the hijackers to take over the planes. · The use of faux journalists to assassinate Ahmed Shah Masood with suicide IEDs hidden in their camera gear was also quite inventive. · Had Richard Reid been able to light the fuse on his shoe bomb, we might still be wondering what happened to American Airlines Flight 63. · The boat bomb employed against the USS Cole in October 2000 was another example of a paradigm shift that resulted in tactical surprise.
        
        Once the element of tactical surprise is lost, however, the new tactics can be countered.
        
        · When the crew and passengers on United Airlines Flight 93 learned what had happened to the other flights hijacked and flown to New York and Washington on Sept. 11, 2001, they stormed the cockpit and stopped the hijackers from using their aircraft in an attack. Aircraft cockpit doors have also been hardened and other procedural measures have been put in place to make 9/11-style suicide hijackings harder to pull off. · Following the Masood assassination, journalists have been given very close scrutiny before being allowed into the proximity of a VIP. · The traveling public has felt the impact of the Reid shoe-bombing attempt by being forced to remove their shoes every time they pass through airport security. And the thwarted 2006 Heathrow plot has resulted in limits on the size of liquid containers travelers can take aboard aircraft. · The U.S. Navy is now very careful to guard against small craft pulling up alongside its warships.
        
        Let`s now take a look at the paradigm shift marked by the Prince Mohammed assassination attempt.
        
        AQAP`s Tactical Innovations
        
        First, using a repentant militant was a brilliant move, especially when combined with the timing of Ramadan. For Muslims, Ramadan is a time for introspection, sacrifice, reconciliation and repentance - it is a time to exercise self-restraint and practice good deeds. Additionally, as previously mentioned, Ramadan is a time when the Saudi royal family customarily makes itself more accessible to the people than at other times of the year. By using a repentant militant who appears on Saudi Arabia`s list of most-wanted militants, AQAP was playing to the ego of the Saudis, who very much want to crush AQAP, and who also want to use AQAP members who have renounced terrorism and the group as part of their ideological campaign against jihadists. The surrender of an AQAP member offered the Saudi government a prize and a useful tool - it was an attractive offer and, as anticipated, Prince Mohammed took the bait. (Another side benefit of this tactic from the perspective of AQAP is that it will make the Saudis far more careful when they are dealing with surrendered militants in the future.)
        
        The second tactical innovation in this case was the direct targeting of a senior member of the Saudi royal family and the member of the family specifically charged with leading the campaign against AQAP. In the past, jihadist militants in Saudi Arabia have targeted foreign interests and energy infrastructure in the kingdom. While jihadists have long derided and threatened the Saudi royal family in public statements, including AQAP statements released this year, they had not, prior to the Prince Mohammed assassination attempt, ever tried to follow through on any of their threats. Nor has the group staged any successful attack inside the kingdom since the February 2007 attack that killed four French citizens, and it has not attempted a major attack in Saudi Arabia since the failed February 2006 attack against a major oil-processing facility in the city of Abqaiq Certainly the group had never before attempted a specifically targeted assassination against any member of the very large Saudi royal family - much less a senior member. Therefore the attack against Prince Mohammed came as a complete surprise. There are many less senior members of the royal family who would have been far more vulnerable to attack, but they would not have carried the rank or symbolism that Mohammed does.
        
        But aside from his rank, Mohammed was the logical target to select for this operation because of his office and how he conducts his duties. Mohammed has long served as the primary contact between jihadists and the Saudi government, and he is the person Saudi militants go to in order to surrender. He has literally met with hundreds of repentant jihadists in person and had experienced no known security issues prior to the Aug. 28 incident. This explains why Mohammed personally spoke on the phone with al-Asiri prior to the surrender and why he did not express much concern over meeting with someone who appeared on his government`s list of most-wanted militants. He met with such men regularly.
        
        Since it is well known that Mohammed has made it his personal mission to handle surrendering militants, AQAP didn`t have to do much intelligence work to realize that Mohammed was vulnerable to an attack or to arrange for a booby-trapped al-Asiri to meet with Mohammed. They merely had to adapt their tactics in order to exploit vulnerabilities in the security paradigm.
        
        The third tactical shift is perhaps the most interesting, and that is the use of an IED hidden in the anal cavity of the bomber. Suicide bombers have long been creative when it comes to hiding their devices. In addition to the above-mentioned IED in the camera gear used in the Masood assassination, female suicide bombers with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam have hidden IEDs inside brassieres, and female suicide bombers with the Kurdistan Workers` Party have worn IEDs designed to make them look pregnant. However, this is the first instance we are aware of where a suicide bomber has hidden an IED inside a body cavity.
        
        It is fairly common practice around the world for people to smuggle contraband such as drugs inside their body cavities. This is done not only to get items across international borders but also to get contraband into prisons. It is not unusual for people to smuggle narcotics and even cell phones into prisons inside their body cavities (the prison slang for this practice is "keistering"). It is also not at all uncommon for inmates to keister weapons such as knives or improvised stabbing devices known as "shanks."
        
        Such keistered items can be very difficult to detect using standard search methods, especially if they do not contain much metal.
        
        In the case of al-Asiri, he turned himself in to authorities on the afternoon of Aug. 27 and did not meet with Mohammed until the evening of Aug. 28. By the time al-Asiri detonated his explosive device, he had been in custody for some 30 hours and had been subjected to several security searches, though it is unlikely that any of them included a body cavity search. While it is possible that there was some type of internal collusion, it is more likely that the device had been hidden inside of al-Asiri the entire time.
        
        AQAP`s claim of responsibility for the attack included the following statement: "...Abdullah Hassan Taleh al-Asiri, who was on the list of 85 wanted persons, was able, with the help of God, to enter Nayef`s palace as he was among his guards and detonate an explosive device. No one will be able to know the type of this device or the way it was detonated. Al-Asiri managed to pass all the security checkpoints in Najran and Jeddah airports and was transported on board Mohammed bin Nayef`s private plane."
        
        AQAP also threatened additional surprise attacks in the "near future," but now that the type of device al-Asiri used is known, security measures can - and almost certainly will - be implemented to prevent similar attacks in the future.
        
        While keistering an IED is a novel tactic, it does present operational planners with some limitations. For one thing, the amount of explosive material that can be hidden inside a person is far less than the amount that can be placed inside a backpack or is typically used in a suicide belt or vest. For another, the body of the bomber will tend to absorb much of the blast wave and most of any fragmentation from the device. This means that the bomber would have to get in very close proximity to an intended target in order to kill him or her. Such a device would not be very useful for a mass-casualty attack like the July 17 Jakarta hotel bombings and instead would be more useful in assassination attempts against targeted individuals.
        
        We have not been able to determine exactly how the device was triggered, but it likely employed a command-detonated remote device of some kind. Having wires protruding from the bomber`s body would be a sure giveaway. The use of a wireless remote means that the device would be susceptible to radio frequency countermeasures.
        
        One other concern about such a device is that it would likely have a catastrophic result if employed on an aircraft, especially if it were removed from the bomber`s body and placed in a strategic location on board the aircraft. Richard Reid`s shoe IED only contained about four ounces of explosives, an amount that could conceivably be smuggled inside a human.
        
        What the Attack Says About AQAP
        
        While the Aug. 28 attack highlighted AQAP`s operational creativity, it also demonstrated that the group failed to effectively execute the attack after gaining the element of surprise. Quite simply, the bomber detonated his device too far away from the intended target. It is quite likely that the group failed to do adequate testing with the device and did not know what its effective kill radius was. AQAP will almost certainly attempt to remedy that error before it tries to employ such a device again.
        
        In the larger picture, this attempt shows that AQAP does not have the resources inside the kingdom to plan and execute an attack on a figure like Prince Mohammed. That it would try a nuanced and highly targeted strike against Mohammed rather than a more brazen armed assault or vehicle-borne IED attack demonstrates that the group is very weak inside Saudi Arabia. It even needed to rely on operatives and planners who were in Yemen to execute the attack.
        
        When the formation of AQAP was announced in January, STRATFOR noted that it would be important to watch for indications of whether the merger of the Saudi and Yemeni groups was a sign of desperation by a declining group or an indication that it had new blood and was on the rise. AQAP`s assassination attempt on Prince Mohammed has clearly demonstrated that the group is weak and in decline.
        
        AQAP has not given up the struggle, but the group will be hard-pressed to weather the storm that is about to befall it as the Saudis retaliate for the plot. It will be very surprising if it is able to carry through with its threat to attack other members of the Saudi royal family in the near future. Indeed, the very fact that AQAP has threatened more attacks on the royal family likely indicates that the threats are empty; if the group truly did have other plots in the works, it would not want to risk jeopardizing those plots by prompting the Saudis to increase security in response to a threat.
        
        Lacking the strength to conduct large, aggressive attacks, the weakened AQAP will need to continue innovating in order to pose a threat to the Saudi monarchy. But, as seen in the Aug. 28 case, tactical innovation requires more than just a novel idea - militants must also carefully develop and test new concepts before they can use them to effectively conduct a terrorist attack.

    textlede: Saudi prince on phone with militant when attacked by suicide bomber
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        The wanted Saudi militant who attacked the kingdom's anti-terror chief after pretending he wanted to surrender blew himself up while the official was on the phone reassuring another terrorist in Yemen that it would be safe to return home, the Interior Ministry said Tuesday. The disclosure offered a strange twist to an already surprising story.
        
        Donna Abu-Nasr
        
        Associated Press
        
        RIYADH: The wanted Saudi militant who attacked the kingdom's anti-terror chief after pretending he wanted to surrender blew himself up while the official was on the phone reassuring another terrorist in Yemen that it would be safe to return home, the Interior Ministry said Tuesday. The disclosure offered a strange twist to an already surprising story. The events that led up to Thursday's attack began when Yemen-based Saudi militant, Abdullah Hassan Tali Assi-ri, got in touch with authorities, saying he wanted to turn himself into Prince Mohammad bin Nayef, said a ministry statement.
        
        The prince, who is the kingdom's assistant interior minister, agreed to see Assiri and received him at his home in the western seaport of Jeddah late Thursday during a gathering to celebrate the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, according to the statement.
        
        During the meeting, Assiri, who was on the country's most-wanted list, told Mohammad that other Saudi militants who had fled to Yemen following the kingdom's fierce anti-terror campaign wanted to surrender too but were seeking safe passage from the prince.
        
        "They wanted to hear this by phone from the prince himself," said the statement.
        
        The statement said contact had been made with one of the men in Yemen while Assiri was in the same room as the prince.
        
        "The explosion occurred during the phone call," said the statement.
        
        "It led to the death of the wanted man."
        
        Government-run Saudi TV showed bits of human flesh, an arm and part of a torso of a young man at the scene of the explosion. But the prince was only lightly hurt.
        
        The ministry statement said investigations have uncovered more details about the attack that will not be revealed at this time for security reasons.
        
        The attack was the first major setback to the kingdom's anti-terror efforts, led by Moham-mad, since February 2006 when suicide bombers tried but failed to attack an oil facility at the Abqaiq oil complex, the world's largest oil-processing facility, in eastern Saudi Arabia.
        
        In remarks early Friday, Mohammad admitted he ordered guards not to search the attacker when he arrived at his home. Saudi officials have said the prince wanted to treat the militant with respect and trust to encourage other wanted militants to come forward.
        
        The Yemen-based Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has claimed responsibility for the attack, identifying Assiri as the bomber. It said the bomber arrived on the prince's plane.
        
        In a taped phone conversation between Assiri and the prince aired Tuesday on Saudi TV, the militant is heard asking for a plane.
        
        The ministry statement did not say if Mohammad sent a private jet to transport Assiri from the Yemeni border to Jeddah. It only said the man arrived with security to the prince's home.
        
        There have been various versions of the events. One, reported by Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya television network, said the attacker concealed the explosives in his anus, allowing him to evade detection. The network also quoted an expert as saying that the method of concealment aimed the blast away from the target, while blowing the bomber to bits.
        
        Assiri's name was on the kingdom's latest most-wanted list, which was released in February. The list includes the names of 83 Saudis and two Yemenis living abroad and suspected of belonging to Al-Qaeda.
        
        A profile of Assiri released by the Interior Ministry said the 24-year-old militant was born in Riyadh.
        
        According to the profile, he was recruited by an Al-Qaeda cell whose goals included assassinations and targeting oil installations in the kingdom. He received self-defense training. In Yemen, he got military training, which included the use of mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and Sam7s.

    textlede: Attack on Saudi security chief evokes fears of Yemen-based militancy
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        An attempt to assassinate Saudi Arabia's security chief, who is a prominent member of the royal family, appears to mark a new tactic by an Al-Qaeda network that is exploiting worsening instability in neighboring Yemen. A suicide bomber posing as a repentant militant failed to kill Prince Mohammad bin Nayef at his Jeddah office on Thursday.
        
        Analysis

        BEIRUT: An attempt to assassinate Saudi Arabia's security chief, who is a prominent member of the royal family, appears to mark a new tactic by an Al-Qaeda network that is exploiting worsening instability in neighboring Yemen. A suicide bomber posing as a repentant militant failed to kill Prince Mohammad bin Nayef at his Jeddah office on Thursday in the first known attack on a Saudi royal since Al-Qaeda began a bloody campaign in the world's top oil exporter in 2003.
        
        "If it had been successful, it would have been an incredibly significant propaganda victory for Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP)," said Christopher Boucek, an associate of the Carnegie Middle East Program.
        
        "But it's not on the level of sophistication seen in previous multiple, coordinated attacks."
        
        The Saudi and Yemeni branches of Al-Qaeda merged early this year to form AQAP. They regrouped in Yemen following a vigorous counterterrorism campaign led by Prince Mohammad, deputy interior minister, that badly damaged militants in Saudi Arabia.
        
        AQAP is led by a Yemeni, Nasser al-Wahayshi, but it named as commanders two Saudis freed from the US detention center at Guantanamo Bay who had later graduated from Saudi Arabia's rehabilitation scheme for militants - run by Prince Mohammad.
        
        Even though one later surrendered to the authorities, that was a setback to a scheme that has won much publicity, al-though though the Saudis say its successes still outweigh occasional failures.
        
        Boucek said that the rehab program was only an adjunct to tough tactics credited with derailing Al-Qaeda's campaign by 2006.
        
        "All of those soft counter-terrorism measures were only possible because of the hard security victories that were achieved earlier on," he said.
        
        "This [attack] is only going to reinvigorate those continuing hard security efforts."
        
        The attack on Prince Mohammad, a son of the interior minister, Prince Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz, who is seen as next in line to be named crown prince, was claimed by AQAP and may have been a gambit to show muscle behind its ambitious rhetoric.
        
        "The group is now aiming to meet the goal of regional reach that it has set for itself," said Gregory Johnsen, a Princeton University analyst, arguing that a months-long lull in AQAP violence indicated consolidation and planning, not inaction.
        
        Earlier this month Saudi authorities announced the arrest of 44 militants and the seizure of explosives, detonators and guns.
        
        In April the Saudis said they had intercepted 11 militants with arms caches near the Yemeni border.
        
        Saudi officials fret that militants are finding refuge in lawless swathes of Yemen, whose security forces are stretched by a tribal revolt in the north and separatist unrest in the south.
        
        "We can't say for sure yet that there is a direct connection bet-ween Yemen and the attack on Prince Mohammad, but Ye-men's security problems are going to affect the region," Boucek said.
        
        Saudi concern about Yemen is shared by Washington, which doubts Sanaa's ability to handle returning Guantanamo inmates.
        
        "We worry about Yemen becoming a safe haven for Al-Qaeda," State Department counterterrorism adviser Shari Villarosa told a Carnegie audience in July.
        
        "Yemen does cooperate with the US in terms of strengthening its law enforcement capabilities, but there is still much room to improve."
        
        She said the US sought to ensure that Yemen does not "become another Afghanistan" and argued that instability in Yemen was also fueling chaos in nearby Somalia.
        
        "Right after Afghanistan-Pakistan, we talk about Somalia and Yemen as our two greatest concerns in terms of counterterrorism."
        
        Yemen joined the US "war on terror" after September 11, 2001, but squirmed when the Pentagon leaked word of a drone missile strike that killed Al-Qaeda's local leader on its soil in 2002.
        
        Foreign Minister Abubakir al-Qirbi told Reuters this month that Yemen had limited resources to combat terrorism and urged the US to share more intelligence information.
        
        President Ali Abdullah Saleh has in the past sometimes co-opted Islamist militants, notably those who returned from Afgha-nistan in the 1990s, but now confronts a new generation of much more radical young fighters who are harder to deal with.
        
        Poverty and corruption in Yemen offer opportunities for Al-Qaeda recruiters in a population of 23 million, two-thirds of whom are aged under 24.
        
        "Al-Qaeda's ideological messages have very little resonance here, but you can radicalize people around a sense of injustice," said a Western diplomat in Sanaa. Militants have attacked tourists, embassies and government targets in recent years, hurting tourism and efforts to lure investment to a country dependent on dwindling oil.
        
        Yemeni government officials frequently accuse Western em-bassies and media of exaggerating the security threat, but analysts such as Carnegie's Johnsen suggest they are in denial.
        
        "One surprising thing is almost a refusal to acknowledge that Al-Qaeda is a local problem, not something imported from Iraq or Afghanistan, something the Americans created," he said.
        
        "In Yemen the government has never felt threatened in the way the Saudi government felt threatened in 2003 and 2004."

    textlede: Al-Qaeda claims attack on Saudi royal
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has identified the suicide bomber who tried to assassinate Saudi Arabia's deputy interior minister, a US monitoring group reported on Sunday. SITE Intelligence Group cited a statement posted on jihadist internet forums as saying Abdullah Hassan Taleh al-Asiri, who blew himself up on Thursday near Prince Mohammad bin Nayef, was on a list of 85 men wanted by the Saudi authorities.
        
        "Mohammad bin Nayef al-Saud ... was struck by mujahid brother, the heroic martyrdom-seeker from the list of 85, Abdullah Hassan Taleh al-Asiri," the statement said.
        
        It said the bomber was able to pass through security checkpoints in Najran and Jeddah airports, and even board the prince's private jet.
        
        "With grace and power from Allah, he was able to enter the palace of the aforementioned and detonate the charge among his guards after he had passed all security checkpoints in Najran and Jeddah airports and transferred it on board the aforementioned's private jet," the statement said.
        
        "The essence and the method of detonation are not and will never be known."
        
        Official Saudi news agency SPA reported on Friday that Prince Mohammad, a royal family member who leads the kingdom's anti-terror fight, escaped with just minor injuries from the attack in Jeddah.
        
        The deputy interior minister suffered only superficial injuries after the bomber got close to him and detonated his explosives, the agency said, quoting a royal court statement.
        
        Apart from the bomber, who was killed, no other serious casualties were reported.
        
        The royal court said the bomber was a wanted "terrorist" who had approached the prince under the pretext that he wanted to give himself up. He detonated his device while he was undergoing security checks, it added.
        
        Prince Mohammad is the son of long-time Interior Minister Prince Nayef bin Abdel-Aziz, who has been in office since 1975. He serves as the minister's assistant for security affairs.
        
        According to analysts, the failed attempt on the life of Saudi Arabia's security chief could strengthen the position of his conservative father in jockeying within the royal family over who becomes king next.
        
        The attack by a suicide bomber posing as a repentant militant has refocused attention on the government's fight against Islamist insurgents, which Prince Mohammad has led since 2003, winning plaudits from US officials.
        
        "The security apparatus, embodied by Prince Nayef and even his son, will wield greater influence on the kingdom's policy agenda," a Western diplomat in Riyadh said.
        
        The world's biggest oil producer, Saudi Arabia is an absolute monarchy without an elected parliament or rights to form political parties, where clerics of an austere school of Sunni Islam control mosques, education, courts and their own public policing body.
        
        King Abdullah is seen as a supporter of Western-friendly reforms which aim to reduce the religious establishment's hold on the country that produced Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
        
        But diplomats say he has been stymied by conservative princes like Nayef, who maintains close ties to the clerics and does not want to upset the traditional balance of power between the religious establishment and the Saudi royal family.
        
        Liberals fear for the fate of reforms if Prince Nayef were to be put in charge of the country, diplomats say.
        
        This was the first high-profile Al-Qaeda attack on the government since militants rammed a car bomb into the fortified Interior Ministry in Riyadh in 2004.
        
        It was also the first strike on a member of the royal family since Al-Qaeda launched a wave of attacks in the kingdom in 2003, targeting Western establishments and oil facilities and leaving more than 150 Saudis and foreigners dead. - AFP, Reuters

        LATEST ATTACK IN FIGHT AGAINST AL-QAEDA RAISES PRINCE NAYEF'S PROFILE
        
        Souhail Karam
        
        Reuters
        
        RIYADH: A failed attempt on the life of Saudi Arabia's security chief could strengthen the position of his conservative father, Interior Minister Prince Nayef, in jockeying within the royal family over who becomes king next.
        
        Prince Nayef, believed to be 76, was appointed second deputy prime minister earlier this year, leaving him in charge of the country when King Abdullah and his appointed successor Crown Prince Sultan - who are both in their 80s - are abroad.
        
        Prince Sultan has been out of the country since November because of unspecified illness and surgery, creating uneasiness over succession.
        
        Newspapers in recent days were full of panegyric articles about Prince Mohammad bin Nayef, with advertisements of thanks featuring portraits of the king, crown prince, Nayef and his son.
        
        "This attack adds to the credit of the Interior Ministry. It confirms the fact that Prince Mohammad bin Nayef has become the foe to beat for Al-Qaeda," said Khaled al-Dakhil, a Saudi politics professor.
        
        "It should get [his father] Prince Nayef a lot of credit among the senior royals."
        
        Nayef has had mixed success in persuading clerics to discourage radical ideology, which espouses violence against Muslims and Muslim governments seen as un-Islamic. Hundreds of suspects have been arrested since 2006 for seeking to form cells and Nayef admonished hundreds of clerics in 2007 for tacit or overt support for Saudis heading to Iraq. He said they were being used as fodder for suicide attacks.
        
        "The level of trust between Prince Nayef and the clerics is unmatched elsewhere," a senior Arab diplomat said.
        
        "He has repeatedly criticized them for not toning down the rhetoric that breeds radicalism, yet they have always been like honey on butter."
        
        Christopher Boucek, an associate in the Carnegie Middle East Program, wondered: "Will the attempted assassination of his son lead him to be more direct in dealing with the clergy? It will be very interesting to see how that plays out."
        
        A stronger Prince Nayef could also embolden clerics in their opposition to reforms, since many of them argue that moves towards"Westernization," such as relaxing the kingdom's system of public gender segregation could also embolden clerics in their opposition to reforms, since many of them argue that moves towards "Westernization," such as relaxing the kingdom's system of public gender segregation, encourages a zealous reaction.
        
        The secrecy of the ruling family and political system means there could still be surprises, the Western diplomat said.

    textlede: Saudi attack evokes fears of Yemen-based militancy

        HIGHLIGHT: An attempt to assassinate Saudi Arabia's security chief, who is a prominent member of the royal family, appears to mark a new tactic by an al Qaeda network that is exploiting worsening instability in neighbouring Yemen.
        
        A suicide bomber posing as a repentant militant failed to kill Prince Mohammed bin Nayef at his Jeddah office on Thursday in the first known attack on a Saudi royal since al Qaeda began a bloody campaign in the world's top oil exporter in 2003,

        "One surprising thing is almost a refusal to acknowledge that al Qaeda is a local problem, not something imported from Iraq or Afghanistan, something the Americans created," he said.
        
        "In Yemen the government has never felt threatened in the way the Saudi government felt threatened in 2003 and 2004."

    textlede: Saudi prince defends policy on militants
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        JEDDAH (Reuters) - Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef defended late on Saturday the policy of enticing "repentant" militants after one tried to assassinate his son, but warned there could be more and worse attacks ahead.
        
        A suicide bomber posing as a repentant militant blew himself up in the Jeddah office of security chief Prince Mohammad Ben Nayef in the first known attack on a member of the Saudi royal family since Al Qaeda began a violent campaign in the world's top oil exporter in 2003.
        
        Saudi Arabia issued a list of 85 wanted suspects in February and analysts said many of them were in Yemen, including some who had been returned to Saudi Arabia from US detention in Guantanamo Bay and some who had been through a much-vaunted Saudi militant "correction" programme.
        
        "The security efforts and strategy that the country is following for reform will not change," Nayef told businessmen at a gathering in Jeddah, defending the correction programme and efforts to win over militants.
        
        "This incident will not change this policy by which we open the door for those who repent."
        
        Al Qaeda on Sunday identified the man who tried to kill the security chief on Thursday as Abdullah Al Asiri, a wanted suspect who entered Saudi Arabia from Yemen, and gave details on how he was allowed to get so close to the prince.
        
        A statement said Asiri was flown to Jeddah from Najran near the Yemeni border after entering from Yemen to give himself up to the interior ministry.
        
        "The hero martyr on the list of 85 wanted persons Abdullah Hassan Tali' Al Asiri, known as Abul-Khair, managed to enter his palace, pass his guards and blow up a package," said a statement on Islamist websites attributed to the "Qaeda Jihad Organisation in the Arab Peninsula".
        
        "He managed to get through all the inspections at Najran and Jeddah airports and travelled on his [the prince's] private jet," it said, accompanied by a picture of Asiri.
        
        It was not possible to verify the statement, which said the Saudi government had a network of spies in Yemen of which the Yemeni government was not aware.
        
        The Saudi and Yemeni branches of Al Qaeda merged early this year to form Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. They regrouped in Yemen after a vigorous counter-terrorism campaign led by Prince Mohammad, who is also deputy interior minister, that badly damaged militants in Saudi Arabia.
        
        Saudi-owned Al Arabiya TV said Asiri was a 23-year-old Saudi whose brother Ibrahim was also on the wanted list.
        
        Prince Nayef predicted there could be more attacks.
        
        "In this country we are targeted... The situation could change and could intensify, not in terms of the number [of attacks] but rather in their nature, and that is more dangerous."
        
        Saudi officials fear militants are finding refuge in lawless swaths of Yemen, whose security forces are stretched by a tribal revolt in the north and separatist unrest in the south.

    textlede: Attempt on life of Saudi prince fails
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        An attempt to assassinate Saudi Arabia's security chief, who is a prominent member of the royal family, appears to mark a new tactic by an al-Qaida network that is exploiting worsening instability in neighbouring Yemen.
        
        A suicide bomber posing as a repentant militant failed to kill Prince Mohammed bin Nayef at his Jeddah office on Thursday in the first-known attack on a Saudi royal since al-Qaida began a bloody campaign in the world's top oil exporter in 2003.
        
        "If it had been successful, it would have been an incredibly significant propaganda victory for al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula(AQAP)," said Christopher Boucek, an associate of the Carnegie Middle East Program.
        
        "But it's not on the level of sophistication seen in previous multiple, co-ordinated attacks."
        
        The Saudi and Yemeni branches of al-Qaida merged early this year to form AQAP. They regrouped in Yemen following a vigorous counter-terrorism campaign led by Prince Mohammed, deputy interior minister, that badly damaged militants in Saudi Arabia.
        
        AQAP is led by a Yemeni, Nasser al-Wahayshi, but it named as commanders two Saudis freed from the U. S. detention centre at Guantanamo Bay who had later graduated from Saudi Arabia's rehabilitation scheme for militants--run by Prince Mohammed. Although one later surrendered to the authorities, that was a setback to a scheme that has won much publicity, even though the Saudis say its successes still outweigh occasional failures.
        
        Boucek said the rehab program was only an adjunct to tough tactics credited with derailing al-Qaida's campaign by 2006.
        
        "All of those soft counter-terrorism measures were only possible because of the hard security victories that were achieved earlier on," he said.
        
        "This (attack) is only going to reinvigorate those continuing hard security efforts."
        
        The attack on Prince Mohammed, a son of the interior minister, Prince Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz, who is seen as next in line to be named crown prince, was claimed by AQAP and may have been a gambit to show muscle behind its ambitious rhetoric.

    textlede: Saudi prince survives suicide bombing attack
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        A suicide bomber failed in his attempt to kill the prince who heads Saudi Arabia's anti-terror campaign, the first attack on a member of the royal family since the start of a wave of violence by Al-Qaeda six years ago. Prince Mohammad bin Nayef, the deputy interior minister and son of the man thought likely to be the next crown prince, was meeting well-wishers Thursday.
        
        Asma Alsharif
        
        Reuters
        
        JEDDAH: A suicide bomber failed in his attempt to kill the prince who heads Saudi Arabia's anti-terror campaign, the first attack on a member of the royal family since the start of a wave of violence by Al-Qaeda six years ago. Prince Mohammad bin Nayef, the deputy interior minister and son of the man thought likely to be the next crown prince, was meeting well-wishers Thursday when a man blew himself up, a ministry spokesman said. The prince was not seriously hurt.
        
        "The attack indicates that the threat is out there waiting to happen - sometimes at closer range than you would think," said one Western diplomat in Saudi, who declined to be named.
        
        "The royals will have plenty of reasons to worry in a country where weapons apparently find easy entry from porous borders to the north from Iraq or the south from Yemen."
        
        As security chief, Prince Mohammad is one of the most powerful men in the kingdom and is credited with the government's success in crushing the violence.
        
        Saudi Arabia, the world's largest petroleum exporter and a key US ally in the Mideast, was forced to confront its own role in rising militancy at home and abroad when its nationals turned out to be behind the September 11, 2001, attacks on the US.
        
        The mastermind of those, attacks, leader of the Al-Qaeda network Osama bin Laden, was born in Saudi Arabia.
        
        Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Saudi arm of the group, claimed responsibility for Thursday's bombing attempt, according to a message posted on Islamist Internet forums and translated by SITE Intelligence Group.
        
        Interior Ministry spokesman Mansour al-Turki said security measures would not be in-creased after the apparent breach, which occurred after the prince ordered guards not to search the militant, who had insisted he was giving himself up.
        
        "The security will not be heightened more than it is at the moment. We have always been saying that we expect [such acts] and act as though they may happen at any moment."
        
        Royals in Saudi Arabia are obliged to receive visitors during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.
        
        The Saudi official news agency said the bomber, whom it did not identify, was the only casualty.
        
        The attack took place in Prince Mohammad's private office in the Red Sea port of Jeddah.
        
        The incident serves to underscore the possibility of attacks in the kingdom itself.
        
        Saudi officials have expressed concern that neighboring Yemen, embroiled in a conflict that has claimed hundreds of lives, could become a staging ground.
        
        Saudi officials worry that militants returning from wars in Iraq or Afghanistan or slipping across the porous border to Yemen may bring with them fighting experience and tactical knowledge of weapons or explosives.
        
        A diplomat from an Arab country, who declined to be idenrified, said the attack, which follows three years of arrests and weapons and explosives seizures, signals that militant networks may extend further than previously thought.
        
        "The authorities have always been breaking up new cells with militants that have not been on their radar screen which shows that the country's continues to be a breeding ground for militancy," he said.
        
        "What is new is the fact that it targeted a royal, not anyone, but literally the kingdom's security tsar."
        
        Al-Arabiyya television showed Prince Mohammad, apparently slightly injured, meeting King Abdullah after the attack.
        
        "This will only increase our determination to eradicate this [militancy]," said Prince Mohammad, who is the son of Interior Minister Prince Nayef bin Abdel-Aziz, recently named second deputy crown prince.
        
        Earlier this month, Saudi authorities announced the arrest of 44 militants close to Al-Qaeda and the seizure of explosives, detonators and firearms.
        
        Human Rights Watch has criticized the country for detaining thousands without charge while Amnesty International said the state had committed human rights violations on a "shocking" scale as part of its anti-terrorism drive.
        
        Some analysts say more militant action is likely.
        
        "Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is like a balloon. You squeeze it on one side and it bulges out on the other," said one Gulf-based security analyst who declined to be identified.

    textlede: Saudi anti-terror chief survives attack; Deputy interior minister is slightly wounded by suicide bomber
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        A suicide bomber detonated explosives hidden inside his mobile phone on Friday in an attempt to assassinate the head of Saudi Arabia's anti-terrorism efforts.
        
        FULL TEXT
        
        A Saudi prince who leads the kingdom's anti-terrorism efforts received minor wounds in the first suicide attack ever on a member of the royal family, news services reported.
        
        Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a Saudi ally of the terrorist network, claimed responsibility for the attack Thursday on Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the deputy interior minister. The claim was posted on Islamist Internet forums and was translated by the SITE Intelligence Group, the Reuters news agency reported.
        
        The Saudi Press Agency said that the prince was meeting well-wishers on Thursday night when a visitor who was undergoing a security inspection detonated explosives hidden on his body. The prince was treated for minor wounds at a hospital and was later shown on state television explaining the episode to King Abdullah.
        
        "This will only increase our determination to eradicate this," said Mr. Mohammed, a bandage wrapped around the middle finger of his left hand, the Saudi Press Agency reported.
        
        The attacker, the agency said, was a wanted militant who had insisted on meeting the prince to announce he was giving himself up to the authorities. Members of the Saudi royal family are obliged to receive visitors during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.
        
        The Saudi Press Agency said the bomber, whom it did not identify, was the only person who died. The attack took place at Mr. Mohammed's office in the Red Sea port of Jidda, it said.
        
        Mr. Mohammed is the son of the interior minister, Prince Nayef bin Abdel Aziz, who is third in line to the Saudi throne. Mr. Nayef has been titular head of the ministry since 1975, but his son is known to have day-to-day operational control of the country's anti-terrorism efforts.
        
        After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Mr. Nayef came under withering criticism in the United States for the kingdom's apparent failure to move against a growing Islamist threat there. The mastermind of the attacks, Osama bin Laden, was born in Saudi Arabia, and most of the attackers were Saudi nationals.
        
        In 2003, militants launched a 20-month wave of violence across Saudi Arabia that included the bombing of foreigners' residential compounds in Riyadh; shootings of Western citizens and the beheading of an American; gun battles in Riyadh, Mecca, and Buraida; suicide attacks on government buildings and oil facilities; an assault on the offices of an American oil company; and the storming of the U.S. consulate in Jidda.
        
        The Interior Ministry responded with a crackdown that has reportedly resulted in thousands of arrests. Amnesty International reported last month that "massive human rights violations" and torture had been committed by the security forces in their efforts to contain the radicalism. The group said an estimated 3,000 people were still being held.
        
        Six weeks ago, the Saudi Press Agency reported, more than 300 militants, many accused of having ties to Al Qaeda, were secretly tried and convicted. Some were given prison terms of 30 years.
        
        The Interior Ministry announced last week that 44 people suspected of being Qaeda terrorists have been arrested this year.
        
        The attack Thursday against the man in charge of the crackdown was the first known assassination attempt against a senior member of the royal family since 1975, when King Faisal was shot and killed at point-blank range by a nephew, Prince Faisal bin Musaid.
        
        The prince was beheaded in a public square in Riyadh three months later. There have been no known Qaeda attacks in the kingdom since 2006.

    textlede: Would-Be Killer Linked To Al Qaeda, Saudis Say
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        A suicide bomber who was trying to kill the head of Saudi Arabia's antiterrorism efforts stumbled just short of his target and fell, detonating an explosion that had been arranged by an affiliate of Al Qaeda, a spokesman for the Saudi Interior Ministry said Friday.
        
        The Saudi official, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who serves as deputy interior minister and is a member of the royal family, was slightly wounded in the attack in the Red Sea port of Jidda, Saudi Arabia, on Thursday, said Gen. Mansour al-Turki, the spokesman for the Interior Ministry.
        
        The prince had allowed the wanted militant, who had come saying he wanted to turn himself in, to bypass security as a sign of good faith, General Turki said. The militant was killed by the explosion, the authorities said.
        
        "He expressed his desire to turn himself in directly to the prince and the prince granted him his complete trust by requesting that he not be searched," General Turki said.
        
        "And this is something that the prince does. It is not the first time, but it did not end in this deceptive manner before."
        
        Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Saudi arm of the terrorist network, claimed responsibility for the attack, according to a message posted on Islamist Internet forums and translated by the SITE Intelligence Group. The attack was the first terrorist assault on a member of the royal family in decades.
        
        It came during the holy month of Ramadan, after a long day of fasting, when the prince was greeting well-wishers in his home. When the man was allowed to bypass the security gate, he stumbled and fell, detonating the explosion, according to Interior Ministry officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release details.
        
        The prince was taken to a hospital, where he was met by King Abdullah, in a meeting broadcast on Saudi television. The king could be heard on the broadcast telling the prince that the man should have been required to go through the security measures, and the prince acknowledged that it was his mistake.
        
        The attacker was a wanted militant who had insisted on meeting the prince to announce that he was giving himself up to the authorities, General Turki said. Members of the royal family in Saudi Arabia traditionally receive visitors during Ramadan and at other times of the year.
        
        General Turki said that the authorities were aware of plans by Islamic militants to kill government officials and religious figures, but that the bombing provided a warning to be vigilant.
        
        Prince Mohammed is the son of the interior minister, Prince Nayef bin Abdel Aziz, who is technically third in line to the Saudi throne.
        
        In 2003, militants launched a 20-month wave of violence across Saudi Arabia that included the bombing of foreigners' residential compounds in Riyadh; shootings of Western citizens and the beheading of an American; gun battles in Riyadh, Mecca and Buraida; suicide attacks on Saudi government buildings and oil facilities; and the storming of the United States Consulate in Jidda.
        
        The Interior Ministry responded with a crackdown that is estimated to have resulted in thousands of arrests. Amnesty International reported last month that "massive human rights violations" and acts of torture had been committed by the Saudi security forces in their effort to contain radicalism.
        
        Six weeks ago, after secret trials, more than 300 militants, many accused of having ties to the Qaeda network, were tried and convicted, and some were given prison terms of 30 years, the Saudi Press Agency reported. Jamal A. Khashoggi, the editor of Saudi Arabia's Al Watan newspaper, said he feared that the attack was a sign of a new tactic for Al Qaeda. Prevented by security operations from carrying out complex bombing attacks, he said, the militants may shift to strategic assassinations of leaders to destabilize the Saudi state.
        
        "It is serious," he said.
        
        "What I am afraid of is that Al Qaeda in Saudi Arabia will be transformed into an assassin's group."

    textlede: Saudi anti-terror chief escapes Qaeda suicide bomb
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        RIYADH: Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, a Saudi royal family member who heads the kingdom's anti-terror fight, escaped little harmed from a suicide bomb attack in Jeddah, official news agency SPA said on Friday.
        
        The deputy interior minister suffered only superficial injuries after the suicide bomber got close to him and detonated his explosives on Thursday evening, the agency said quoting a royal court statement.
        
        The Saudi wing of Al-Qaeda was swift in claiming responsibility.
        
        In a statement posted on an Islamist website late on Thursday, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula said it was behind the bomb, according to US-based monitoring group, SITE Intelligence.
        
        The bomber was the only casualty. Prince Mohammed was receiving guests at the end of the day's fasting during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, SPA said.
        
        The royal court said the bomber was a wanted terrorist who had approached the prince under the pretext he wanted to give himself up.
        
        He detonated his device while he was undergoing security checks, it added.
        
        Saudi television showed images of the prince after the attack. SPA posted a photo of him receiving King Abdullah at the hospital. The anti-terror chief did not seem affected by his ordeal and the only bandage was on the middle finger of his left hand.
        
        Prince Mohammed is the son of long time Interior Minister Prince Nayef bin Abdul Aziz, who has been in office since 1975. He serves as the minister's assistant for security affairs.
        
        This was the first high-profile Al-Qaeda attack against the government since militants rammed a car bomb into the fortified interior ministry in Riyadh in 2004.
        
        It was also the first strike on a member of the royal family since Al-Qaeda launched a wave of attacks in the kingdom in 2003, targeting Western establishments and oil facilities and leaving more that 150 Saudis and foreigners dead.
        
        Authorities in Saudi Arabia, home of Al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden and 15 out of 19 hijackers who carried out the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, responded by killing scores of the organization's militants and rounding up hundreds more.
        
        Earlier this month, Saudi authorities announced the arrest of 44 high-profile Al-Qaeda operatives with large caches of arms.
        
        By some estimates more, than 3,000 are held by police for suspected links to Al-Qaeda while nearly 1,000 have been charged with terror-related offenses. -AFP

    textlede: Is Yemen Breaking Apart ?
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        In power for more than 30 years, Field Marshall Ali Abdallah Saleh, Yemen's veteran President, is battling for his political life. He has ruled the north since 1978, and the whole country since 1990, but the problems now assailing him on all sides are the worst he has ever had to deal with.
        
        Like other Arab autocrats, such as President Husni Mubarak of Egypt, in power since 1981, and Muammar al-Qadhafi, the 'Guide' of Libya's 1969 revolution, Yemen's President runs a country which, in theory, has a multi-party system. In fact, his word is law - but a law which is now being violently contested in several parts of the country. Many of the problems he faces have roots in the key events of Yemen's often violent past - in particular, the overthrow of the theocratic Zaidi Imamate by a republican coup in 1962, and the union in 1990 of North Yemen, ruled by President Ali Abdallah Saleh's People's Conference Party, with South Yemen, then ruled by the Socialist Party. The union has not been altogether successful. Disasters soon followed its formation, notably the expulsion in 1990 of close to a million Yemeni workers from Saudi Arabia, when Yemen backed Saddam Hussein in his occupation of Kuwait. This serious blow to what was already a very poor country brought widespread misery. In 1994, the South tried to break away with a war of secession. But the war ended, after much bloodshed, with the North's victory and the occupation on 7 July of the South's capital city of Aden. Many smouldering resentments were thus created, that are now bursting into flame. One might say that history has caught up with the embattled Field Marshall. The South is once again clamouring to secede from the union and establish its own independent state, under the leadership of Ali Salem al-Beid, a former president of the southern region. Heading the pressure for secession is the so-called Peaceful Southern Mobilization Movement, which is clearly not as peaceful as its name suggests. Indeed, the south appears to be arming itself in preparation for a new confrontation. This summer has seen a spate of violent demonstrations against the government in Sanaa - and, in response, a violent crack-down by the authorities. An enemy of the central government who is at least as dangerous is Abd al-Malik al-Huthi, leader of a rebel movement in the north of the country, which has been battling the government on and off since 2004. Abd al-Malik's relative, Hussein al-Huthi, the first leader of the movement, was killed in the early months of the rebellion. President Ali Abdallah Saleh has vowed to crush the rebels, accusing the Huthis of wanting to destroy the Republic and restore the Zaidi Imamate. This month, he sent his army on a punitive expedition against the northern rebels - operation Scorched Earth -which, according to Aboudou Karimou Adjibade, UNICEF representative in Yemen, has led to the flight, in great distress, of more than 100,000 people, many of them children. The UNHCR in Geneva says that, in the rebel stronghold of Saada - capital of Yemen's northernmost province on the Saudi border - 35,000 people have fled their homes in the past two weeks alone. The UN World Food Program airlifted 40 tons of high-energy biscuits to Yemen last week to feed the refugees. But access to them is difficult because of the fighting. Government troops, backed by aircraft and artillery, have tried to open the roads to Saada, which the rebels had managed to block. But the rebels still control the mountains overlooking the town. This is the worst outbreak of violence in Yemen since the 1994 war of secession. Casualties are said to be very great. Although the Huthis are Zaidis -- a branch of Shi'a Islam -- it is not clear whether they really aspire to restore the Imamate or are simply rebelling against what they consider unfair treatment and economic discrimination by Sanaa. They are certainly demanding a degree of autonomy. In any event, the conflict is threatening to draw in outside powers. Yemen's Information Minister Ahmad al-Lawzi has indirectly accused Iran of supporting the Huthi rebels, while the Yemeni army has claimed to have captured Iranian-made weapons - including machine-guns, short-range rockets and ammunition. Saudi Arabia is concerned that the fighting could provide Iran with an opportunity to extend its influence to its borders. Tehran, meanwhile - always concerned for the safety of Shia communities -- has called for a peaceful settlement of the conflict. These uprisings in the north and south have caught the President and his government at a difficult moment. Oil production at about 320,000 barrels daily is dwindling. The fall in oil prices has hit the country hard. A population growth rate of well over 3 per cent - the highest in the Middle East --is expected to boost the population from 18 million at present to 35 million in 2029, exacerbating the many social and economic problems. A perennial Yemeni problem is the production of qat, a drug to which many Yemenis are addicted. It is the country's primary cash crop, occupying an estimated 145,000 hectares of land, up from 80,000 hectares a decade ago. It is a major source of tax revenue, but also a source of great corruption, involving some of the highest officials as well as many farmers. It also contributes to Yemen's grave water shortage. If this were not enough, Yemen appears to have attracted Al-Qaeda cells, including the one responsible for the bombing of USS Cole in the port of Aden in October 2000, which killed 17 U.S. sailors. Many suspected Al-Qaeda operatives were rounded up and jailed, but in February 2006, 23 of them - including those believed responsible for the bombing of the USS Cole - managed to escape by tunnelling out of the prison to a nearby mosque. Among those who escaped was Nasir al-Wahayshi, 33, a former secretary of Osama bin Laden, who is thought to be the leader of al-Qaeda in Yemen. Reports suggest that cells in Yemen and Saudi Arabia have united to form al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, raising the alarm of counter-terrorist agencies in the United States and elsewhere, which fear that Yemen may become a terrorist safe haven. Yemen may need the mediation of neighbouring countries - including the Gulf States, Saudi Arabia and even Iran, to help it resolve its internal conflicts. Above all, it urgently needs help for health, education, economic development and job creation. USAID is this year providing Yemen with the paltry sum of $24million, in scandalous contrast to the billions being wasted by the United States on unwinnable and unnecessary wars. end

        In power for more than 30 years, Field Marshal Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemen's veteran president, is battling for his political life. He has ruled the north since 1978, and the whole country since 1990, but the problems now assailing him from all sides are the worst he has ever had to deal with.

    textlede: al Qaeda influence in Yemen kidnaps, murders Terror surge
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        `This is a very disturbing development. It is the first time foreigners have been kidnapped in Yemen and executed straight away.'
        
        THE rare murder of foreigners kidnapped in north Yemen has given the Yemeni government a jolt over the resurgence of al Qaeda in the troubled Arabian Peninsula country.
        
        Last month the bodies of two German women and a South Korean female companion were found after they and six other Westerners were abducted in the northern Saada province near Saudi Arabia in an attack that analysts said bore the hallmarks of al Qaeda.
        
        ``This is a very disturbing development. It is the first time that foreigners have been kidnapped in Yemen and executed straight away," said Christopher Boucek, an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.
        
        ``The situation is much more suggestive of al Qaeda type violence than has been seen elsewhere (in Yemen)."
        
        Yemen has blamed rebels of a Shi'ite sect that is battling the Sanaa government, a claim the group has denied and which analysts see as unlikely despite Shi'ite strength in the north.
        
        Tribesman disgruntled over marginalisation by the central government have often abducted foreigners, usually tourists, but rarely has it ended in deaths.
        
        Despite a large search operation with the help of German and British investigators and government rewards for information, the kidnappers remain at large and the fate of the remaining seized foreigners remains unknown.
        
        ``The government has saved no effort and security bodies are doing their job on a wide scale. There is cooperation with the Germans and British," Information Minister Hasan al-Lawzi said at a news conference this month.
        
        Yemen and US military targeted al Qaeda figures in the impoverished country, the ancestral home of the network's leader Osama bin Laden, after the 9/11 attacks.
        
        An unmanned CIA drone fired a missile that killed al Qaeda's leader in Yemen in 2002.
        
        But in January Yemeni militants announced they had adopted the name Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and named two Saudis released from Guantanamo Bay as its commanders.
        
        Militants under the al Qaeda banner claimed an attack that killed four South Korean tourists in March as well as mortar attacks on foreign embassies last year.
        
        Yemen's foreign minister last week downplayed the idea that al Qaeda militants were relocating from Iraq and Afghanistan as ``exaggerated" -- yet he did not deny the reports.
        
        Rather, he accused al Qaeda, a Sunni militant group, of trying to enflame the Shi'ite rebellion in the north and violence in the south, where secessionist sympathisers have clashed with security forces, to create more destabilisation.
        
        Gregory Johnson, an analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said a jail break by al Qaeda suspects in 2006 seems to mark the beginning of al Qaeda's revival in Yemen. ``The current incarnation of al Qaeda in Yemen has more recruits -- and younger recruits -- than ever," he wrote this month.
        
        Two Yemenis were among a list of 83 wanted militants issued by Saudi authorities in February.
        
        But Boucek said 26 of the men on the Saudi list are believed to be in Yemen and 11 in total are Guantanamo detainees released by Washington to Saudi Arabia who have returned to militancy, information he published after meetings with Saudi officials.
        
        The rest are in Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan, he said.
        
        Neighbouring Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, has said it fears instability in Yemen could allow it to become a launchpad for a revival of a 2003-2006 campaign by al Qaeda militants to destabilise the US-allied ruling Al Saud family.
        
        Even if al Qaeda was not behind the killings, they are a sign of the increasing radicalisation in Yemen, analysts say.
        
        Hassan Abu Taleb of the Al Ahram Centre for Strategic and Political Studies in Cairo said that despite Saudi fears, its puritanical brand of Sunni Islam had played a key role in creating a fertile environment for al Qaeda in Yemen.
        
        ``Over the last 20 years Yemen has been a launchpad for al Qaeda elements and some tribes in the centre of the country have blood and close links with al Qaeda elements," he said. - Reuter

        RIYADH âEUR" A Saudi court has sentenced suspected militants to jail terms of up to 30 years in the first publicly reported trials since Al Qaeda-linked militants began a campaign in 2003 to destabilise the worldâEUR(TM)s top oil exporter. The court gave verdicts against 289 Saudis and 41 foreigners, the state news agency SPA said on Monday, without disclosing the nationalities. The sentences handed down to 323 defendants ranged from a few months to 30 years. Seven were acquitted of some charges, while others were banned from travelling abroad, SPA said. Saudi Arabia has said the trials involved âEURoemembership of a deviant group of people and involvement in their activities and supporting and financing of terrorismâEUR. Officials usually use âEURoedeviant groupâEUR as a reference to members of militant groups including Al Qaeda. Interior Minister Prince Nayef bin Abdul Aziz said in October that the kingdom had indicted 991 mainly Saudi suspected Al Qaeda militants for carrying out 30 attacks since 2003. A group called Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula began a campaign to destabilise the government in 2003 but the violence was brought to a halt by security forces in cooperation with foreign experts. Rebel attacks included suicide bombs at housing compounds in Riyadh in 2003 and an attempt to storm the worldâEUR(TM)s biggest oil processing plant at Abqaiq in 2006.

        A Saudi court has sentenced 323 people for links to anti-government groups in the first publicly reported trials in the kingdom since the attacks in 2003.
        
        The court gave verdicts against 289 Saudis and 41 foreigners, the state news agency SPA said on Monday, without disclosing their nationalities. Sentences ranged from a few months to 30 years. Seven were acquitted of some charges, while others were banned from travelling abroad, SPA said.

    textlede: Saudi court convicts 330 "terrorists", sentences one to death
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Text of report by UAE Dubai-based AlArabiya.net on 8 July
        
        [Unattributed report: "One Man Sentenced to Death, All Will Be Able To Appeal; Saudi Court Convicts 330 Terrorists for Attacks"]
        
        A Saudi court tried 330 charged with involvement in al-Qaeda's violent 2003 campaign of attacks inside the country and sentenced one person to death, the justice ministry said on Wednesday. State television said the rulings involved 330 suspects in 179 cases but did not give a breakdown of the sentences or specify how many were acquitted.
        
        Sentences ranged from house arrest to imprisonment and, in one case, the death penalty. More than 1,500 suspects are to go on trial and the media are expected to be allowed to cover the appeals, a court official told Al Arabiya on condition of anonymity. All those convicted will be able to appeal the decision, Dr Mohammed Alnjami, a member of the Islamic Fiqh Academy in Riyadh, told Al Arabiya.
        
        In the first of the long-awaited trials of 991 people charged after the Qaeda campaign, an unspecified number were convicted on charges including conspiring with al-Qaeda, plotting to disrupt national security and financing terrorism, the ministry said in a statement. The accused include some clerics - Nasser al-Fahd, Ali al-Khodeir and Faris al-Shuweil - who had publicly backed the militants. Fahd and Khodeir appeared on Saudi state television after their arrests in 2003 to call for an end to the bloodshed.
        
        Deadly attacks
        
        Saudi former al-Qaeda militants play volleyball at a rehabilitation centre for militants in Riyadh. The trials related to a series of attacks in Riyadh carried out between 2003 and 2006 that killed more than 120 people, including 74 members of the security forces and 90 civilians including foreign residents.
        
        The group called al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula carried out suicide bombing at upscale compounds housing mostly European and American expatriates in Riyadh and at al-Mohaya compound, which housed mostly Arab expatriates west of Riyadh in 2003,
        
        The trials also covered attacks on the interior ministry headquarters and other government offices in Riyadh and a failed attempt in 2006 to storm the world's biggest oil processing plant in eastern Saudi Arabia, the last militant operation of note.
        
        Rehabilitation
        
        Saudi Arabia has arrested hundreds of suspects over the last two years on suspicion of trying to revive militant cells and created a successful rehabilitation programme.
        
        The munasaha, Arabic for "advice," programme in which the Saudi government enrolls repentant terrorists and returnees from Guantanamo or militant camps outside the kingdom has even been examined as a model for similar programmes in the U.K. and Canada.
        
        Alnjami said that Wednesday's judicial ruling did not indicate that the government's rehabilitation programme for extremists and al-Qaeda suspects had failed. The vast majority have been rehabilitated only a minority had to stand trial, he added.
        
        Those the suspects were tried according the Shari'ah law, and the fact that only one was sentenced to death, while others were acquitted or put under house arrest, demonstrated the independence of the Saudi judiciary, said Alnajami.

    textlede: International: Courts convict 331 in Saudi al-Qaida trials
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Saudi Arabian special security courts have convicted more than 300 people for al-Qaida terrorist activities in the first known trials of members of the group in Osama bin Laden's ancestral homeland.
        
        Al-Arabiya, a privately-owned Saudi TV station, reported yesterday that 331 people in 179 cases had been tried and one given the death sentence. It quoted a justice ministry official as saying there had also been prison terms, travel bans, fines and house arrests, with an unspecified number of defendants acquitted.
        
        Those convicted were described as having been involved in "supporting and financing terrorism" as well as going to "areas of conflict to fight" - an apparent reference to Iraq and Afghanistan, where Saudi nationals have made up a large proportion of all foreign fighters.
        
        Saudi Arabia, backed by the west, has pursued a successful anti-terrorist strategy since May 2003, when al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula first surfaced in the kingdom, home to 15 of the 19 hijackers in the 9/11 attacks.
        
        Al-Qaida's 30 attacks targeted expatriate residential compounds, oil installations and government buildings. The authorities claimed to have foiled a further 160 attacks. In the worst single incident 22 foreign workers were killed in an attack on the Gulf city of al-Khobar in May 2004.
        
        Hundreds of alleged militants have passed through government rehabilitation and re-education programmes. But there have also been allegations of torture and ill treatment. Human Rights Watch has said Saudi trials may not meet international standards and that up to 3,000 people were still detained without charge.
        
        The Saudi interior minister, Prince Nayef bin Abdul Aziz, announced last October that 991 suspects had been charged with participating in attacks over the preceding five years. It was not known before yesterday's announcement that any trials had begun, probably for security reasons.

    textlede: High-tech plan to seal Saudi border
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Saudi Arabia has signed a deal with Eads, the European defence and aerospace group, to build a high-tech security system along its land and sea borders. The $2.8bn scheme is aimed at curbing people, weapons and drugs smuggling across 9,000km of the Gulf state's frontiers.
        
        The surveillance system includes radar facilities, coastal detection centres, telecommunications networks and reconnaissance aircraft. Brigadier-General Mansour al-Turki, an interior ministry spokesman, said the project "will help our performance at the border so we will be able to minimise the ability of terrorists and criminals to take advantage of the borders to smuggle people, weapons and drugs". Top priority It follows a deal made in March between Eads and Al Rashid, its Saudi Arabian partner, to install a razor-wire fence, thermal imaging and radar equipment along the country's 900km border with Iraq.
        
        "This deal covers the rest of the border. It involves much technology, radar, camera systems," a Saudi official said. Eads said the planned security system will "ensure border coverage is visible and managed at the sector level, whilst simultaneously providing situational awareness at the regional and national level". The border project was first envisaged in the 1990s in the wake of the first Gulf War to secure Saudi Arabia's border with Iraq with physical fencing and high-tech monitoring. But with increased worries over infiltration into the country by anti-government and al-Qaeda operatives, and a rise in illegal immigration from around the region, the Saudi interior ministry expanded the scope of the programme to fence and electronically monitor all the country's borders. Securing the 1,300km-long border with Yemen is also a priority after militants announced in January the creation of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.

        SANAA, June 16 -- Yemeni authorities have arrested the financier of Al-Qaeda operations in the country and in neighbouring Saudi Arabia, an official said Sunday, as cited on the defence ministry news website."The arrested man is named Hassan Hussein bin Alwan, a Saudi national, and he is the financier for attacks launched by Al-Qaeda organisation in Yemen and Saudi Arabia," the unnamed security official told September Net website."He is considered one of the most dangerous members of Al-Qaeda," he added.In January the local Al-Qaeda branch in Yemen announced in a video message posted on the Internet the merging of the Saudi and Yemeni branches into "Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula," led by a Yemeni, Nasser al-Wahaishi.Yemen, the ancestral land of Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, has witnessed a number of attacks claimed by the organisation in recent years against foreign missions, tourist sites and oil installations.The New York Times reported on Friday that dozens of Al-Qaeda fighters and some of the extremist group's leaders are shifting to Somalia and Yemen from their haven in Pakistan's tribal areas amid US military pressure.But a Yemeni official on Saturday dismissed the report as "fabrications that are baseless" claiming that Yemen "is not a suitable place for terrorists to use as a safe haven."Published by HT Syndication with permission from Right Vision News.

    textoriginal: |
        Five years on, a man faces trial in the opaque Saudi justice system for the killing of Irish cameraman Simon Cumbers in Riyadh but the Cumbers family is upset at being completely shut out by the authorities
        
        THE NAME OF the Riyadh suburb where Irish cameraman Simon Cumbers was shot dead exactly five years ago elicits very different responses depending on who you talk to in Saudi Arabia. Government officials protest that it is an ordinary district. Al Suwaidi is a residential area of Riyadh just like any other, Maj Gen Mansour Al Turki, security spokesman for the interior ministry, insisted during an interview earlier this year. But mention the area to other Saudis, and the response is likely to be similar to the man who told me many of his fellow countrymen refer to Al Suwaidi as the country s Fallujah.
        
        Six months before Simon and the BBC s security correspondent Frank Gardner arrived in Saudi Arabia to report on the aftermath of a militant attack in the eastern city of Al Khobar in which 22 foreigners were killed, Al Suwaidi had been the scene of a shoot-out between Saudi security forces and militants. For some time, 15 of the kingdom s 26 most wanted were men with links to the suburb.
        
        But when the two journalists reached the outskirts of Al Suwaidi in the late afternoon of June 6th to shoot some general footage of the area, there seemed to be little cause for worry. They had waited for permission from the Saudi ministry of information before going, and they had an official minder plus a government-supplied car and driver.
        
        Al Suwaidi, then as now, with its pastel-coloured villas surrounded by towering walls and gleaming SUVs parked outside, does not look like a militant stronghold, much less the teeming slum described in some news reports of the attack in 2004. When I drove around Al Suwaidi in February, accompanied, at the government s insistence, by a minder for the first and only time during my assignment in Saudi Arabia this despite official assurances the area was normal the impression was more of a typical sleepy Gulf suburb. Its quiet residential streets were cleaved with highways and dotted with fast-food outlets.
        
        THAT WAS ALSO Gardner s impression as he and Simon prepared to leave after filming for about 30 minutes. It was their last job, on the last day of their assignment to Saudi Arabia, and when a car pulled up a short distance away there appeared to be scant reason for suspicion.
        
        But the car turned out to be one of two vehicles containing members of an al-Qaeda cell travelling between north and south Riyadh for a meeting with Abdul Aziz Isa al-Muqrin, then leader of an outfit known as al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. They saw the two foreigners and decided to kill them. It was a question of being in the wrong place at the wrong time more than anything else, says Simon s father, Bob, as he thumbs through photographs at the family home in Navan.
        
        His son died from a shot to the back of the head. Gardner survived, despite being shot six times in the shoulder, leg and, at point-blank range, four times in the lower back. His injuries left him paraplegic. Even now, five years on, many of the details remain vague. The coroner at Simon s inquest noted that the case was very much reliant on second- if not third-hand accounts. We re kept in the dark by the Saudi authorities. We re still not even 100 per cent sure of what happened to Simon, says Bob.
        
        His son s body was found about a kilometre away from where Gardner was shot. Initially the Cumbers family was told that Simon must have run away but the gunmen gave chase and then shot him dead. Some months later the Saudi authorities said they had killed all but one of the six militants responsible. Al-Muqrin himself died in a two-hour gunfight just two weeks after the attack.
        
        They allege the remaining man, who has been in custody since 2005, admitted killing Simon, but he gave a different version of what happened that day. He claimed the gang fired through the back window of the ministry car after Simon jumped in. The driver sped off holding the injured Simon by his collar but lost his grip and the cameraman s body slumped out on the ground. But the accounts so far are sketchy and several questions remain, says Bob. We re relying on the trial to really come out with the facts as to what exactly happened, he says.
        
        When that trial may take place, and whether it will be open to the public, is another matter. The wheels of justice move at a glacial pace in Saudi Arabia s notoriously opaque legal system. Simon s alleged killer, a man named Adil Sa ad Al-Dubayti Al-Mutayri, who was 28 at the time of the shooting, is one of 991 al-Qaeda suspects currently awaiting trial in the kingdom. No details of trial dates or specific charges related to any of the 991 indicted militants have been made public.
        
        The entire trial process is quite obscure \.\.\. We ve heard almost nothing concrete about it whatsoever, says Gardner.
        
        We get no information at all, says Bob. I ve been sending two letters a year for five years and we ve had two letters from the Saudis acknowledging receipt. Nothing else.
        
        We have been advised that the first we may hear of it will be when the trial is over and the fellow has been executed.
        
        The last communication the Irish embassy in Riyadh received from the Saudi authorities about the case was in early March. They were told that files relating to the case were with the judges. No other information was forthcoming.
        
        Bob, who travelled to Saudi Arabia with his wife Bronagh to repatriate their son s body, has asked the Saudi government for permission to attend the trial. He says he would like to make representations on behalf of the family, and perhaps on behalf of the accused.
        
        I know from Simon s point of view \.\.\. he was a pacifist and he certainly didn t believe in the death penalty and neither do we. We do wish the individual to be punished but not in that way.
        
        WHAT RANKLES WITH the Cumbers family is the way they have been treated by the Saudi authorities. No Saudi official met the family when they arrived in the kingdom some days after the killing and none attended Simon s funeral or memorial services.
        
        are devastated by Simon s death and our suffering is intensified by the apparent indifference shown by the Saudi government, wrote Bob in one letter to the Saudi embassy in London. The failure of your government to extend the common courtesies to me, my wife and family speaks volumes.
        
        Gardner points out that the case is different to that of other killings carried out by militants in Saudi Arabia. It was certainly very embarrassing for because they invited us to come to the country. Their ambassador in London at the time said: We have nothing to hide, come to Saudi, we will guarantee your security, you will be looked after , he recalls.
        
        Gardner says initial promises of compensation have come to nothing.
        
        For a country that is rolling in money I think it is very shoddy, he argues. I am in a wheelchair for the rest of my life \.\.\. and they could have eased that by dipping into their vast reserves, but they have failed to do that. There s no excuse for it.
        
        Gardner, who has not been back to Saudi Arabia, is at pains to stress that he bears no ill will towards ordinary Saudis, many of whom wrote letters of sympathy following the attacks.
        
        NEITHER DOES BOB. I ve often been asked who s to blame for this. I know who is allegedly responsible, but the two people to blame are George W Bush and Tony Blair. Why else would Muslim Arabs attack an innocent team of television correspondents?
        
        He brushes away the argument that the ideology that drove his son s killers existed before Bush and Blair came to power. Not to the same extent, not to the same extent, he says.
        
        Five years after their son s death, the Cumbers family is under no illusion about the way things work in Saudi Arabia, but, despite the passing of time, their desire for answers and justice remains as strong as ever. The letters Bob regularly sends to the Saudi authorities will soon be mailed to a Dublin address the kingdom is due to open an embassy in Ireland later this month. I am determined to see this to the end, he says.

    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        In a prominent Hadith, the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) said: "If disorder threatens, take refuge in Yemen."
        
        The Prophet was referring to the prosperous and civilised Yemen. But today disorder and radicalisation in Yemen are beginning to infect Saudi Arabia, and thus the safety of the world's largest oil producer.
        
        The Prophet's hadith about Yemen has enjoyed new resonance ever since the 1980's, when Saudi Arabia -- in line with American policy  -- sought to export domestic dissenters, most prominently Osama bin Laden, a Yemeni of Saudi birth, to fight Soviet infidels in Afghanistan. Although dissent was mostly diverted to Afghanistan, bin Laden's most trusted companions (his wife, too) have remained mainly in Yemen. In the wake of the Taleban's ouster in Afghanistan, bin Laden and his followers have come to regard Yemen, alongside Pakistan, as a haven. Indeed, Yemen is now a bubbling cauldron of jihadis who have flocked there because it, like Afghanistan and Pakistan, has weak, easily manipulated [#x2028]state institutions.
        
        US President Barack Obama's recent order to shut down the Guantánamo Bay detention facility has made the problem of Yemen's weakness a leading international issue. One-third of the Guantánamo detainees are Yemeni, but Yemen cannot guarantee the United States that the detainees will be controlled effectively if they are returned home. This fear is real. Many previously released Guantánamo inmates have disappeared underground.
        
        Saudi Arabia, unlike Yemen, has supposedly created a "model" system for reintegrating and re-educating Guantánamo returnees. The Al Munasaha rehabilitation center is supposed to "cure" jihadi passions, and Saudi returnees from Guantánamo who spend time at Al Munasaha are later offered jobs and wives. But many of them relapse and escape to Yemen. Most notorious among these recidivists is Abu Sufyan Al Shihri, now "Deputy Leader of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula."
        
        Seven other Saudi jihadis who escaped to Yemen are also known to be active in Al Qaeda there.
        
        Thus the two largest countries on the Arabian peninsula -- Saudi Arabia, the biggest in terms of landmass and oil wealth, and Yemen in terms of population -- are now locked in life-and-death struggles with internal enemies. The paradox is that, though the threat to both countries is the same, each is worsening the outlook for the other by the policies they are pursuing.
        
        For example, in the 1980's, millions of Yemeni men worked in the Kingdom. Remittance income formed a big part of Yemen's budget. But in 1991, 800,000 Yemenis were expelled because they were seen as a domestic security threat in the run-up to the first Gulf war. Since then, Yemeni labour has been banned from Saudi Arabia.
        
        Embittered and unemployed, young Yemeni men often become subject to another Saudi policy gone awry -- its propagation for export of the Sunni Wahhabi form of Islam. With new Wahhabi madrasas popping up everywhere in Yemen because of Saudi financial support, it is small wonder that the number of Yemeni jihadis has [#x2028]grown exponentially.
        
        But Yemen, too, is engaged in its own destructive policies. President Ali Abdullah Salih has regularly used Yemeni Wahhabis to defeat his domestic opponents -- first the Communists, then the Zaidis, and then the Huthis. Saudi Arabia's relationship with Yemen is unlike that with any other Arab country. The two countries are joined through historical, ethnic, and tribal ties, yet neither has the means to resolve popular resentments and resistance.
        
        Saudi Arabia's traditional "soft power" foreign policy tools -- lavish spending of oil money and da'wa, "the Call" -- are no longer effective. Building fences and sending helicopters to police the borders will not be sufficient, and the idea that jihadis can be rehabilitated is a myth.
        
        No medicine will work if, when the patient is released, he encounters the same virus: institutionalised Wahhabism. Yet there are things the Saudis can do to vaccinate themselves, and Yemen, from fanaticism. The tentative moves toward liberalisation that King Abdullah has made over the past two years need to be accelerated, made more daring, and become more effective in removing the Wahhabi ideology as an incubator for radicalism.
        
        This should not be impossible, because both Saudi Arabia and Yemen have moderate, indigenous Islamic traditions that can be mobilised against jihadism. If given the financial support that the Wahhabis received, these forces could reverse the current drift to fanaticism. Both King Abdullah and President Salih understand the problem; they need to stop using the old tactics and grasp the strategic need [#x2028]for change.
        
        The first change is economic. Instead of exporting radicalism, Saudi Arabia must start importing Yemeni manpower by lifting its ban on Yemeni workers.
        
        Yemeni officials have also requested admission to the Gulf Cooperation Council. Up to now, GCC leaders have spurned Yemen's membership for the same reasons that the European Union fears admitting Turkey: Yemen would instantly become the bloc's most populous country. Indeed, Yemen's population exceeds that of all six GCC members -- Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Oman, and Saudi Arabia - combined. But if Yemen's masses are not to become more radicalised, they will need to be incorporated into an economic zone that offers hope for the future. The GCC can and must assume that role.
        
        Yemen is strategically important, not only for Saudi Arabia, but for the world, because it is the only country on the Arabian Peninsula from which oil can reach the open seas without passing through a narrow strait -- either the Strait of Hormuz or the Suez Canal. To endanger this passage is to endanger the world economy's energy lifeline.
        
        When considering Yemen's future, therefore, the stakes could hardly [#x2028]be higher.

        Mai Yamani: The spread of fanaticism must be halted in a nation so insecure it could not accept Guant[#xfffd]namo inmates for fear of losing them

    textlede: [MAI YAMANI] Next-door terror poses threat to Saudis
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        LONDON - In a prominent hadith, the Prophet Mohammed said: "If disorder threatens, take refuge in Yemen."
        
        The Prophet was referring to the prosperous and civilized Yemen. But today disorder and radicalization in Yemen are beginning to infect Saudi Arabia, and thus the safety of the world's largest oil producer.
        
        The Prophet's hadith about Yemen has enjoyed new resonance ever since the 1980s, when Saudi Arabia - in line with American policy - sought to export domestic dissenters, most prominently Osama bin Laden, a Yemeni of Saudi birth, to fight Soviet infidels in Afghanistan. Although dissent was mostly diverted to Afghanistan, bin Laden's most trusted companions (his wife, too) have remained mainly in Yemen.
        
        In the wake of the Taliban's ouster in Afghanistan, bin Laden and his followers have come to regard Yemen, alongside Pakistan, as a haven. Indeed, Yemen is now a bubbling cauldron of jihadis who have flocked there because it, like Afghanistan and Pakistan, has weak, easily manipulated state institutions.
        
        U.S. President Barack Obama's recent order to shut down the Guantanamo Bay detention facility has made the problem of Yemen's weakness a leading international issue. One-third of the Guantanamo detainees are Yemeni, but Yemen cannot guarantee the United States that the detainees will be controlled effectively if they are returned home. This fear is real. Many previously released Guantanamo inmates have disappeared underground.
        
        Saudi Arabia, unlike Yemen, has supposedly created a "model" system for reintegrating and re-educating Guantanamo returnees. The Al Munasaha rehabilitation center is supposed to "cure" jihadi passions, and Saudi returnees from Guantanamo who spend time at Al Munasaha are later offered jobs and wives.
        
        But many of them relapse and escape to Yemen. Most notorious among these recidivists is Abu Sufyan Al Shihri, now "deputy leader of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula."
        
        Seven other Saudi jihadis who escaped to Yemen are also known to be active in al-Qaida there.
        
        Thus the two largest countries on the Arabian peninsula - Saudi Arabia, the biggest in terms of landmass and oil wealth, and Yemen in terms of population - are now locked in life-and-death struggles with internal enemies. The paradox is that, though the threat to both countries is the same, each is worsening the outlook for the other by the policies they are pursuing.
        
        For example, in the 1980s, millions of Yemeni men worked in the Saudi kingdom. Remittance income formed a big part of Yemen's budget. But in 1991, 800,000 Yemenis were expelled because they were seen as a domestic security threat in the run-up to the first Gulf war. Since then, Yemeni labor has been banned from Saudi Arabia.
        
        Embittered and unemployed, young Yemeni men often become subject to another Saudi policy gone awry - its propagation for export of the Sunni Wahhabi form of Islam. With new Wahhabi madrasas popping up everywhere in Yemen because of Saudi financial support, it is small wonder that the number of Yemeni jihadis has grown exponentially.
        
        But Yemen, too, is engaged in its own destructive policies. President Ali Abdullah Salih has regularly used Yemeni Wahhabis to defeat his domestic opponents - first the Communists, then the Zaidis, and then the Huthis.
        
        Saudi Arabia's relationship with Yemen is unlike that with any other Arab country. The two countries are joined through historical, ethnic, and tribal ties, yet neither has the means to resolve popular resentments and resistance.
        
        Saudi Arabia's traditional "soft power" foreign policy tools - lavish spending of oil money and da'wa, "the Call" - are no longer effective. Building fences and sending helicopters to police the borders will not be sufficient, and the idea that jihadis can be rehabilitated is a myth. No medicine will work if, when the patient is released, he encounters the same virus: institutionalized Wahhabism.
        
        Yet there are things the Saudis can do to vaccinate themselves, and Yemen, from fanaticism. The tentative moves toward liberalization that King Abdullah has made over the past two years need to be accelerated, made more daring, and become more effective in removing the Wahhabi ideology as an incubator for radicalism.
        
        This should not be impossible, because both Saudi Arabia and Yemen have moderate, indigenous Islamic traditions that can be mobilized against jihadism. If given the financial support that the Wahhabis received, these forces could reverse the current drift to fanaticism. Both King Abdullah and President Salih understand the problem; they need to stop using the old tactics and grasp the strategic need for change.
        
        The first change is economic. Instead of exporting radicalism, Saudi Arabia must start importing Yemeni manpower by lifting its ban on Yemeni workers.
        
        Yemeni officials have also requested admission to the Gulf Cooperation Council. Up to now, GCC leaders have spurned Yemen's membership for the same reasons that the European Union fears admitting Turkey: Yemen would instantly become the bloc's most populous country.

But if Yemen's masses are not to become more radicalized, they will need to be incorporated into an economic zone that offers hope for the future. The GCC can and must assume that role.

    textlede: Yemen Times reports statement by Al-Qa'idah leader Al-Wuhayshi
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Text of report in English by Yemen Times newspaper website on 13 May
        
        [Unattributed report: "Al-Qaeda calls for Islamic rule in south Yemen."]
        
        The leader of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula Nasser Al-Wuhayshi declared on Wednesday [13 May] his support for what he called "the rejection of oppression", referring to the protests which have been taking place since April in the southern cities.
        
        At least eight Yemenis, including four soldiers, have been killed in a week of unrest in Abyan, Lahj and Aldhala'a, where witnessed clashes between the government and groups of locals who complained that northerners have abused a unity agreement to grab their resources and discriminate against them, and raised slogans call[ing] for separating their governorates from Yemen, which was united in 1990.
        
        "What you are demanding is your right granted to you by your religion... injustice, oppression and tyranny should not be practised in the name of unity," Al-Wuhayshi said in a audiotape carried by SITE Intelligence, a US group that monitors Islamist websites.
        
        "We in the Al-Qaeda network support what you are doing: your rejection of oppression practised against you and others, your fight against the government and your defending yourself."
        
        Al-Qa'idah called for Islamic rule in Yemen and vowed to retaliate for what it said was the killing of civilians in the clashes.
        
        "The time for the rule of Islam has come so that you could bask in the justice and tolerance it brings" said Al-Wuhayshi, also known as Abu Basir
        
        "The injustice that befell you, God willing, will not pass without punishment. The killing of Muslims in the streets is a great crime that has no justification."
        
        Al-Wuhayshi criticized President Ali Abdallah Salih saying: "As far as we are concerned, Ali Abdallah Salih is an infidel and an agent... and today he is using all forms of oppression with the pretext of preserving unity."
        
        The US has backed Yemen's moves to crack down on Al-Qaeda after the September 11, 2001 attacks on US cities.
        
        Yemen has witnessed a number of attacks claimed by the organization in recent years against foreign missions, tourist sites and oil installations.

    textlede: Analysis: Limits to Exporting the Saudis' Counterjihadist Successes
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        HIGHLIGHT: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia historically has played a major role in the development of jihadism.
        
        Key pillars of the Saudi state - oil, Wahhabism (a conservative form of Sunni Islam) and the strength of tribal norms - were instrumental in facilitating the rise of Islamist extremism and terrorism around the world prior to 9/11.
        
        These same pillars allowed Riyadh to contain al Qaeda within Saudi Arabia in the wake of the insurgency that kicked off in the kingdom in 2003-2004. After this success on the home front, Riyadh is still using these pillars to play an international role in counterjihadist efforts - a role welcomed by the United States.
        
        During a visit to the kingdom last week, U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said the Saudi rehabilitation program for former militants impressed him, prompting him to consider sending Yemeni detainees at Guantanamo Bay to Saudi Arabia as part of Washington`s efforts to close down the detention center.
        
        The Saudis probably have done "as good, if not a better, job of that than almost anybody," Gates said of the Saudi program.
        
        In separate comments, Gates called on Riyadh to assist Pakistan in the latter`s efforts to combat its rapidly expanding Taliban insurgency - and Saudi Arabia in fact has been playing a role in efforts to contain the and Afghanistan for some time.
        
        Clearly, Saudi Arabia is taking a lead role in anti-extremism, counterterrorism and deradicalization efforts. Understanding what the Saudis are doing and how it has permitted them to succeed in this regard will shed light on Riyadh`s domestic successes, and it will indicate what can be expected from its efforts abroad.
        
        Saudi Domestic Counterjihadist Successes
        
        The Saudis have had ample experience in dealing with religious extremists and militants since long before their struggle with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in the aftermath of 9/11.
        
        The kingdom`s founder, King Abdel-Aziz, faced a situation similar to that now faced by Pakistan before he defeated the Ikhwan in the 1920s. The Ikhwan (not to be confused with the Egyptian group Ikhwan al-Muslimeen, which is Arabic for "Muslim Brotherhood") was a tribal religious militia of extremist Wahhabis.
        
        Whereas the Pakistanis have nurtured jihadist groups as tools of foreign policy in their dealings with India and Afghanistan, the Ikhwan helped Abdel-Aziz conquer most of present-day Saudi Arabia.
        
        While Abdel-Aziz was not interested in conquering additional territories, the Ikhwan had larger regional ambitions.
        
        The group wanted to expand its jihad into places like Iraq, which the British then controlled. Just as Pakistan has found itself caught between its Islamist militant assets and the United States in the aftermath of 9/11, the nascent kingdom had to decide between the Ikhwan and its first Great Power ally, the United Kingdom.
        
        Exigencies forced Abdel-Aziz to choose the British, and he put down a subsequent Ikhwan rebellion.
        
        Petrodollars
        
        Notably, this all occurred before the discovery of oil and Saudi Arabia`s subsequent emergence as a petrodollar-rich monarchy (and for that matter, even before the state was known as the "Kingdom of Saudi Arabia").
        
        While the Saudis did not have their present financial resources, they did have one very important tool they wielded successfully against the Ikhwan threat.
        
        That tool was religion, which had become a key part of the fabric of the Saudi state since its first incarnation in the mid-1700s.
        
        Religion mixed in with a culture based on strong elements of tribalism and familism provided for a strong social contract involving the Saudi royal family, the family of Muhammad bin Abdel-Wahhab (founder of the Wahhabi school of thought) and the masses.
        
        This historic Saudi-Wahhabi alliance has long provided the state with religious legitimacy, which the royal family has used to put down religious dissent on a number of occasions since the Ikhwan uprising.
        
        Key among them were the 1979 incident in which a group of Wahhabi militants took over the Kaaba, the dissent within the religious establishment in the aftermath of the 1990-1991 Gulf War, and the 2003-2004 al Qaeda insurgency.
        
        The use of religion to consolidate national power has led to a significant blowback, as evident from the global emergence of violent Islamism. But unlike other states, Saudi Arabia has been able to mobilize the tribal, religious, security and commercial spheres of the country against Islamist rebels.
        
        Religion and Tribalism
        
        The secret to the Saudis` success was turning the rebels` strongest weapon, religion, back against them. This was possible because the state enjoyed a monopoly over religious discourse thanks to the vast religious establishment that Riyadh had cultivated over the years.
        
        Paradoxically, while this religious establishment has been the source of much radicalism in Saudi Arabia and worldwide, it also has served the Saudis well in terms of giving the state a powerful tool with which to quell dissent and preserve the regime.
        
        The tribal nature of Saudi society, with its norms of obedience to those in authority, complemented the state`s religious tools. The Saudi ulema supported by the tribes have laid great emphasis on Quranic notions of obedience to rulers as long as the rulers do not clearly defy Islam.
        
        Another important tribal and religious concept is abhorrence of social chaos, which also helped the Saudis isolate the Islamist rebels from the rest of society by arguing that jihadist activity would lead to anarchy.
        
        Tribal social structure imposes a hierarchy that forms a strong bulwark against rebellions by forcing conformity upon the tribes, clans and families. This limits the social space available for rebels to operate in. Tribes cooperate with the authorities in taking action against belligerents, and then they also take responsibility for the "good behavior" of repentant militants.
        
        The power of the tribal norm is such that it is very unlikely that militants could influence enough tribes to mount a successful uprising. The Saudis have had some two-and-a-half centuries` worth of experience at skillfully managing tribal politics.
        
        The rise and fall of the first (1744-1818) and second (1824-1891) Saudi states and the establishment of the modern kingdom in the early 1900s were to a great degree a function of the ruling al-Saud family`s ability to forge tribal alliances.
        
        Prior to 9/11, one Saudi strategy for dealing with products of the Wahhabi establishment who exhibited levels of extremism deemed intolerable involved directing the radicals to fight in war zones like Afghanistan, Central Asia, the Balkans and the Caucasus.
        
        This maintained order and security while the rebels were away (and in many cases the radicals died in the fighting). Even after 9/11 - and particularly in the wake of the 2003 US invasion of Iraq - the Saudis employed this approach to defuse domestic tensions and to try to contain increasing Iranian influence in Iraq and the rise of Tehran`s Iraqi Shiite allies.
        
        But US-Saudi tensions in the aftermath of 9/11 reached a point where Riyadh knew this was no longer an option.
        
        Consequently, under the guidance of King Abdullah, the kingdom embarked upon a strategy of permanently dealing with the issue through reforms at the governmental and societal levels, a process that is still very much a work in progress. The aim was to curb further extremism, as well as to address existing radicalism.
        
        High oil prices, which lasted until July 2008, gave the country the financial wherewithal to invest in such a major anti-jihadist initiative. But without a powerful religious establishment at its side, the money alone would not have permitted the Saudis to succeed.
        
        This religious establishment has played a key role in the country`s rehabilitation program, which is designed to integrate militants who have surrendered or been captured back into society.
        
        While financial resources have played a critical role in efforts to bring previously radicalized youths back into the mainstream, the scholars have provided the theological gravitas to counter the jihadist ideology and wean the youths from jihadism.
        
        As mentioned, the process is still in its infancy, and incidents of recidivism have occurred.
        
        For example, Said Ali al-Shihri emerged in Yemen as a key leader of the jihadist node on the Arabian Peninsula after undergoing the rehab program.
        
        Still, the Saudis` ability to put a major dent in the capabilities of jihadists in the kingdom and to avoid major backlash to the reform process highlights Riyadh`s successful use of religion to curb extremism.
        
        The jihadist threat within the kingdom remains, but a combination of unique circumstances enabled Saudi Arabia to make considerable progress on the home front.
        
        Fears still exist that because of the ultraconservative religious nature of the state, the monarchy might fall and be replaced by a radical regime - especially as the kingdom enters an extended period of transition. But for now, the Saudi situation is stable to the point where the Saudis can look beyond their borders and offer help to other jihadist trouble spots.
        
        Replicating Saudi Counterjihadist Successes
        
        Saudi Arabia`s counterjihadist successes and position as a religious and financial leader of the Islamic world have prompted the United States and countries like Yemen, Afghanistan and Pakistan to seek Riyadh`s help with jihadist problems.
        
        Yemen
        
        The first such place to do so is just south of the Saudi border. along with their counterparts from Iraq, Somalia and elsewhere under new management.
        
        The that are weakening the state and raising fears of regional instability among Yemen`s wealthier Arab neighbors.
        
        For example, Yemen`s north-south divide is re-emerging, meaning that there are two competing nationalisms in the country.
        
        As a result, Sanaa and Riyadh have moved toward greater cooperation, especially on the issue of the jihadists; the Saudis can offer financial assistance and advice to the cash-strapped Yemenis regarding the Saudi rehabilitation program.
        
        But unlike Saudi Arabia, where the Saudis have the upper hand in the relationship with the religious establishment, the Yemeni state is dependent upon its religious leaders and upon the Salafist-jihadists who dominate the country`s security establishment.
        
        Moreover, Yemen is not as religiously homogenous as Saudi Arabia. While in Saudi Arabia, the religious establishment was strong enough to claim the mantle of Wahhabism and isolate the jihadists as "deviants," Yemen would have to develop an alternative religious discourse to successfully counter the theological challenge posed by the jihadists.
        
        Engendering a mainstream national religious identity takes a long time even for those states endowed with resources, which means there are serious limitations on how far Yemen can expect to succeed in anti-extremism and counterterrorism efforts.
        
        Like Saudi Arabia, Yemeni society is also tribal, but it is much more fragmented than that of its richer, larger neighbor. Unlike Saudi Arabia, where the House of al-Saud sits at the top of the tribal hierarchy, Yemeni tribes are neither as strong nor as organized.
        
        Moreover, the Yemeni state is dependent upon the tribes for support - explaining why Saana`s bid to win tribal assistance in dealing with militants has not attained the desired results.
        
        The huge differences in economic conditions, religious hierarchy and tribal structures between Saudi Arabia and Yemen accordingly will make it difficult for Riyadh to reproduce in its southern neighbor the successful results it has enjoyed at home.
        
        Afghanistan and Pakistan
        
        Saudi Arabia enjoys a disproportionate amount of influence over both Pakistan and Afghanistan.
        
        For example, Saudi intelligence chief Prince Muqrin has recently been involved in efforts to negotiate with the Afghan Taliban.
        
        Likewise, the Pakistani interior minister and the two most senior generals of the Pakistani military have made trips in recent months to the kingdom - most likely not just for monetary assistance, but also to benefit from the Saudi experience in dealing with the Taliban problem.
        
        Ground realities in Afghanistan and Pakistan make these states much more difficult nuts to crack than even Yemen, which shares some basic social similarities with Saudi Arabia.
        
        The security situations in Afghanistan and Pakistan are in advanced stages of deterioration (though to different degrees).
        
        Both South Asian neighbors face full-blown insurgencies, making it difficult for the respective states to maintain their writ in the affected areas. This is quite different from anything Saudi Arabia has ever faced, and it also is different from Yemen, where the jihadists have not transformed themselves into a guerrilla movement.
        
        On the religious front, Afghanistan and Pakistan lack religious establishments.
        
        Instead, they both have highly fragmented religious landscapes consisting of rival Islamist groups, competing Sunni sects and networks of madrassas.
        
        Even the two countries` more mainstream ulema are divided into various groups. Unlike in Saudi Arabia and (to a lesser degree) Yemen, only a tiny minority adheres to Salafist/Wahhabi Islam in Southwest Asia.
        
        Even so, the Deobandis (the sect of the Taliban and other Islamist militant groups) are a growing movement, posing a challenge to the Shia and the majority Barelvis (a South Asian form of Sufi Islam).
        
        On the social level, while tribes exist in both South Asian states, they are very weak compared to the Arab states in question. In Afghanistan, the tribal hierarchy is almost nonexistent in terms of being able to project power because of the rise of the mullahs and militia commanders.
        
        In Pakistan, the tribes are limited to Pashtun areas, and even there the mullahs and militiamen have significantly degraded the power of the tribal maliks.
        
        These factors place significant limits on how much the Saudis can assist Islamabad or Kabul in their respective counterinsurgency efforts and anti-extremism drives.
        
        For these reasons, the Saudis have focused on trying to broker talks between the Taliban and the Western-backed Karzai regime in Afghanistan.
        
        Even on this issue, Riyadh is not having much luck, because the Taliban elements it has been dealing with thus far have been former leaders of the movement, while current Taliban chief Mullah Muhammad Omar and his associates have rejected the idea of talks because they feel they have the upper hand in the insurgency and do not see the West as "staying the course" in their country.
        
        Meanwhile, in Pakistan the Saudis have been focused on efforts to create a consensus among various stakeholders on how to deal with the militancy. Riyadh maintains strong ties with Pakistan, especially with the military establishment and right-of-center forces, particularly the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, as well as with several of the country`s Islamist political parties.
        
        As a result, the Saudis may be able to use their financial and energy clout to get the religiously and socially conservative forces in Pakistan to agree to support a major state initiative to contain the violence.
        
        But in sharp contrast to the way Riyadh took a focused approach to its own Islamist rebels, Islamabad lacks coherence.
        
        Therefore, given the social fragmentation and complexities of the two South Asian states, the Saudis will not be able to help either Afghanistan or Pakistan much in terms of bringing down the violence those countries face.
        
        It can, however, assist in curbing religious extremism by undermining jihadists, given the ideological proximity of the Deobandis and the Wahhabis. But since the Saudis are still working on the ideological front through rehabilitation at home, it will be awhile before they can help others.
        
        Saudi Arabia`s successes in rolling back religious radicalism at home are the result of the confluence of certain unique circumstances that simply do not exist in more troubling jihadist hot spots like Yemen, Afghanistan and Pakistan.
        
        The Saudi example thus offers few lessons for Sanaa, Kabul and Islamabad in dealing with their own situations.
        
        Ultimately, while the Saudis will be able to play an important role in providing financial assistance and some help in ideologically undermining Islamist extremism and radicalism, they will be able to do less on the physical battlefield.

    textlede: Al-Qaeda claims attack on Koreans in Yemen
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        SANAA: An Al-Qaeda wing in Yemen yesterday claimed responsibility for the attack that killed four South Korean tourists in southeastern Yemen this month, saying it was in retaliation for the killing of two militant leaders in a police raid.
        
        In a statement posted on the Internet, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula said the March 15 attack in Hadramaut province was intended to avenge the killing of leading Al-Qaeda members in Yemen Hamza Al-Quaiti and Abdullah Ba-Tais in a police sting operation last August. A suicide bomber blew himself in the historic city of Shibam on March 15, killing four South Korean tourists and their Yemeni guide. Authorities blamed the attack on Al-Qaeda. Officials have said a second attack that targeted South Korean investigators in Sanaa three days later was also the work of Al-Qaeda. The statement, whose authenticity could not be confirmed, said the attack was carried out also in response to "South Korea's role in the war on Islam as it allied with crusader forces under the guise of a war on terrorism in Afghanistan and Iraq."
        
        It named the Shibam attacker with his alias Abu-Obaida Al-Jarrah. Authorities have identified the attacker as the 18-year-old Abdul-Rahman Mahdi Al-Ujairi. South Korea, a close US ally, sent 3,600 engineering and medical troops to Iraq in 2004, providing the third largest foreign troop presence in the war-battered country at the time. In December it completed its troop withdrawal, ending a four-year mission in Iraq. Seoul also sent medical and engineering troops to Afghanistan but pulled its 210 soldiers out in 2007 after 23 South Korean aid workers were taken hostage by the Taleban. Yemen's Interior Ministry said on Wednesday that police forces had arrested six suspected Al-Qaeda militants who were plotting 12 attacks on oil installations, foreign interests and tourists in the country.

    textlede: Saudi terror suspect quoted on Yemen Qa'idah links to Iran, Huthists
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Text of report in English by state-run Yemeni news agency Saba website
        
        Riyadh, March 28 (Saba): Mohammed Ateeq al-Aufi al-Harbi, an al-Qaeda leader who was earlier handed over to Saudis after he handed himself in to Yemeni authorities, has said that al-Qaeda in Yemen has links to Iranian intelligence services and Houthi rebels in Saada.
        
        In his confessions aired by the Alarabiya channel, al-Aufi said al-Qaeda affiliates in Yemen are run by intelligence apparatuses of influential governments which administer them in the name of Mujahedeen targeting Yemen and Saudi Arabia.
        
        " We receive money from these governments and through Mujahedeen," he said, adding Houthis came to us once and offered us money and logistic support and then I, in my capacity as a filed commander of al-Qaeda in Yemen, started to understand that our group is administered by countries.. but not youth as we learnt.
        
        We realized there was a delusive administration for us, he went on.
        
        He revealed al-Qaeda new plans to attack foreign targets and oil facilities in Yemen and the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
        
        "Al-Qaeda in Yemen became stronger after we, Saudi al-Qaeda branches, came to the country and merged with those colleagues in Yemen," he said.
        
        "Al-Qaeda in Yemen was not effective but when Saudi al-Qaeda members arrived in the country a real al-Qaeda network started to take shape, he added.
        
        After the merge, we formed a shoura council and named a leader, a deputy leader, a military and media officers."
        
        I led about 250 followers that were organized in military brigades operating according to war plans.
        
        Al-Qaeda in Yemen, which was said recently to have taken shape by the merge of members in Yemen and the kingdom under the name of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula with a new leadership declared earlier last month, chose Nasser al-Wuhaishi as leader and started to implement their strategy disseminating misinformation and carrying out terrorist attacks in the two countries.
        
        They take advantage of strategic mountainous locations at which new members can join the group to fight as gorillas.
        
        Among his confessions, al-Aufi said his surrender came after he differed with the new leadership over expiatory fatwas against people and countries, urging the rest members to come back to the right path and give themselves up to authorities.
        
        On February 17, Yemen extradited al-Aufi to Saudi authorities, twenty days after he had surrendered to Yemeni authorities in Shabwa province.
        
        Earlier, al-Qaeda announced a new leadership for its branches in the Arabian Peninsula.
        
        Yemen and Saudi Arabia in 2003 inked an extradition deal and vowed to boost coordination and security cooperation to defeat al-Qaeda targeting the two neighbour countries.

    textlede: Pakistan: A Bogus Threat and the Bigger Picture
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        HIGHLIGHT: On March 5, the Saudi Embassy in Islamabad reportedly received threatening e-mails warning of attacks on Saudi interests in Pakistan. According to English-language Pakistani newspaper The Nation, the e-mails purportedly were sent by al Qaeda and threatened attacks on targets such as the Saudi Embassy and Saudi airline facilities in Pakistan.
        
        When we heard the reports of this threat, our initial reaction was to dismiss it. While al Qaeda has sometimes made vague threats before executing an attack, it does not provide a list of precise targets in advance. Prior to the June 2008 in Islamabad, al Qaeda leaders repeatedly threatened to attack European (and Danish) targets in retaliation for a published in Denmark in 2005 that satirized the Prophet Mohammed. When the issue was reignited in early 2008 with the release of a called "Fitna," by Dutch parliamentarian Geert Wilders, Osama bin Laden himself issued a statement in March 2008 in which he threatened strikes against European targets in retaliation. However, in all of these threats, al Qaeda never specified that it was going to strike the Danish Embassy in Islamabad. In addition to being out of character for al Qaeda, it is foolish to issue such a specific threat if one really wants to strike a target. While we were able to discount the most recent e-mail threat reportedly sent to the Saudi Embassy in Islamabad, it generated a robust discussion among our analytical staff about Saudi counterterrorism and anti-jihadist activities in Pakistan and Afghanistan, the large number of threatening statements senior al Qaeda members have made against the Saudis and the very real possibility of an attack against Saudi interests in Pakistan.
        
        Threats Against the Saudis Beginning with some of bin Laden`s early public writings, such as his August 1996 "Declaration of War against the Americans Occupying the Land of the Two Holy Places," al Qaeda leaders have spoken harshly against the Saudi royal family. Bin Laden and others have accused the Saudis of collaboration with the "Zionist-Crusaders alliance" that bin Laden claimed was using military force to impose "iniquity and injustice" on the people of Islam. However, the verbal threats directed against the Saudi royal family have escalated in recent years in the wake of a string of attacks launched inside Saudi Arabia by the Saudi al Qaeda franchise in 2003 and 2004, and as the Saudi government has conducted an to crush the Saudi franchise and combat the wider phenomenon of jihadism. In fact, it is rare to see any statement from a senior al Qaeda leader that does not condemn the Saudi government specifically or in more general terms. In a July 28, 2008, , al Qaeda ideologue Abu Yahya al-Libi called on Muslims to act quickly and decisively to kill the Saudi king, reminding them that "killing this reckless tyrant, who has declared himself the chief imam of atheism, will be one of the greatest qurubat" (an act of devotion bringing man closer to God). In a May 2008 message, al-Libi also had urged Saudi clerics to lead uprisings against the Saudi monarchy similar to the July 2007 in Islamabad. Al-Libi never mentioned Saudi King Abdullah by name in that message, preferring to call him the "lunatic apostate" because of the king`s call for a dialogue among Islam, Christianity and Judaism. Commenting on this interfaith dialogue in the July 2008 message, al-Libi also said, "By God, if you don`t resist heroically against this wanton tyrant ... the day will come when church bells will ring in the heart of the Arabian Peninsula."
        
        In March 2008, al Qaeda No. 2 Ayman al-Zawahiri said the Saudi monarchy was part of a "satanic alliance" formed by the United States and Israel to blockade the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip. In a January 2009 message, al-Zawahiri said: "Oh lions of Islam everywhere, the leaders of Muslim countries are the guards of the American-Zionist interests. They are the ones who have given up Palestine and recognized Israel ... Abdallah Bin Abd-al-Aziz has invented the interfaith dialogue and met Peres in New York, paving the way for the complete recognition of Israel."
        
        Al-Zawahiri continued, "Thwart the efforts of those traitors by striking the interests of the enemies of Islam."
        
        In a February 2009 audio statement, al-Zawahiri declared, "The Muslim nation must, with all its energy and skills, move to remove these corrupt, corrupting and traitorous rulers."
        
        After a January 2009 video by jihadists in Yemen announcing the formation of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, al-Zawahiri proclaimed in a February statement that the new organization "is the awakening, which aims to liberate the Arabian Peninsula from the Crusader invaders and their treacherous agents. It is escalating and flourishing, with God`s help and guidance, despite all the campaigns of repression, misleading, and deception, and despite all the obstacles, difficulties and hindrances."
        
        Focus on the Saudis All these threats raise an obvious question: Why is al Qaeda so fixated on the Saudis? One obvious reason is that, since the launching of a disastrous offensive by the Saudi al Qaeda node, the Saudi government - which previously had turned a blind eye to many of al Qaeda`s activities - has launched a full-court press against the organization. Al-Zawahiri acknowledged this in a December 2005 message entitled "Impediments to Jihad," in which he said the Saudi franchise in the kingdom had been defeated by collaborators. The Saudi offensive against al Qaeda also played a significant part in the Anbar Awakening in Iraq. Saudi cajoling (and money) helped persuade Iraqi tribal leaders to cooperate with the coalition forces. One way the Saudis have really hurt al Qaeda is by damaging its ability to raise funds. For example, in March 2008, the top Saudi cleric, Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul-Aziz bin Abdullah al-Sheikh, cautioned Saudis against giving money to charities or organizations that finance "evil groups" who are known for harming Islam and its followers - a clear reference to al Qaeda and other jihadist organizations. We have repeatedly seen appeals for more funds for the jihad, and in a Jan. 14, 2009, message by bin Laden, he noted that the jihadists were under financial "distress" and that it was the duty of the Muslim ummah to support the jihadists "with all their soul and money."
        
        Perhaps one of the greatest threats the Saudis pose to al Qaeda is the threat to its ideological base. As STRATFOR has long argued, there are in the war against jihadism - the physical and the ideological. For an ideological organization such as al Qaeda that preaches persecution and martyrdom, losses on the physical battlefield are expected and glorified. The biggest threat to the jihadists, therefore, is not a Hellfire missile being dropped on their heads, but an ideological broadside that undercuts their legitimacy and ideological appeal. Many Saudi clerics have condemned jihadism as a "deviance from Islam."
        
        Even prominent Saudi clerics who have criticized the Saudi government, such as Salman al-Awdah, have sent open letters to bin Laden condemning violence against innocents and claiming that al Qaeda was hurting Muslim charities through its purported ties to them. The sting of the ideological attacks is being felt. In a May 2008 speech, al-Libi addressed the ideological assault when he said, "and because they knew that the key to their success in this plan of theirs is to turn the people away from jihad and mujahidin and to eliminate them militarily and intellectually."
        
        Al-Libi recognized that without new recruits and funding, the jihad will wither on the vine. In addition to financial and ideological threats against the organization, the Saudi assault has also gone after al Qaeda where it lives - in Pakistan. Deep Connections Saudi Arabia has long had a strong relationship with Pakistan, based on shared perspectives toward regional and international matters. A key common sphere of influence for the two sides over the past four decades has been Afghanistan. This close Saudi-Pakistani relationship was well-illustrated by the pairing up of Saudi petrodollar wealth with Pakistani logistics (along with U.S. weapons and intelligence) to support the Islamist uprising that followed the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. After the Soviet military withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Saudis and the Pakistanis continued to cooperate. Even though the world at large refused to accept the Taliban regime after it took power in 1996, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates recognized the Taliban as the legitimate rulers of Afghanistan. (These three were the only countries to do so.) However, while enjoying support from Riyadh and Islamabad, the Taliban also established relations with the transnational jihadist forces led by al Qaeda. The Saudi and Pakistani relationship with the Taliban was shattered by the events of 9/11. In spite of aggressive negotiations with the Taliban, neither the Saudis nor the Pakistanis could convince Mullah Omar to surrender bin Laden and the al Qaeda leadership to the Americans. Because of this, the two countries were forced to end their overt relationship with the Taliban as the Americans invaded Afghanistan, though they obviously have maintained some contact with members of the Taliban leadership. The U.S. response to 9/11 placed the Saudis and the Pakistanis into a very difficult position, where they were forced to fight jihadists on one hand and try to maintain control and influence over them on the other. As previously discussed, the Saudis possessed the resources to effectively clamp down on the al Qaeda franchise in the kingdom, but Pakistan, which is weaker both financially and politically - and which has become the center of the jihadist universe on the physical battlefield - has been hit much harder by the U.S.-jihadist war. This situation, along with the ground reality in Afghanistan, has forced the United States to begin working on a political strategy to bring closure to the U.S.-jihadist war that involves negotiating with the Taliban if they part ways with al Qaeda and the transnational jihadists. Hence the recent visit by Taliban officials to Saudi Arabia and the trips made by Riyadh`s intelligence chief, Prince Muqrin bin Abdel-Aziz, to Pakistan and Afghanistan. The Saudi monarch, King Abdullah, is also rumored to be personally involved behind the scenes in efforts to pressure Taliban leaders to break free from al Qaeda. But as in the past, the Saudis need help from their allies in Islamabad and Rawalpindi, and here is where they are running into problems. A weak and threatened Pakistani state means that before working with the Pakistanis on the Afghan Taliban, Riyadh has to help Pakistan combat its own Taliban problem, which the Saudis currently are attempting. The Saudis obviously have much to offer the Pakistanis, in terms of both cash and experience. They also have the religious cachet that other Pakistan allies, such as the Americans and the British, lack, giving them the ability to broach ideological subjects. However, as is the case with the Afghan Taliban, the Saudis will have to get the Pakistani Taliban to part ways with al Qaeda and are working hard to drive a wedge between Pakistani militants and their foreign guests. These efforts to divide the Taliban from the global jihadists are happening not only during the plush, Saudi-sponsored trips for Taliban members to conduct Hajj and Umrah in the kingdom. Following a strategy similar to what they did in Iraq, the Saudis and their agents are meeting with Taliban commanders on the ground in Pakistan and Afghanistan to twist arms and offer cash. They also are coordinating very closely with the Pakistani and Afghan authorities who are leading the campaign against the jihadists. For example, Rehman Malik, the Pakistani adviser to the prime minister on the interior (Pakistan`s de facto terrorism czar), traveled to Saudi Arabia in January at the invitation of Saudi Interior Minister Prince Naif bin Abdul-Aziz to discuss improving counterterrorism cooperation between the two countries. Many of the 85 most-wanted militants on the list recently released by the Saudi government are believed to be in Pakistan, and the Saudis are working with Malik and the Pakistanis to arrest those militants and return them to Saudi Arabia. A Clear and Present Danger Bin Laden, al-Zawahiri, et al., are well aware of these Saudi moves, which they see as a threat to their very existence. When asked in a November 2008 interview what he thought of the Saudi efforts to mediate between Afghan President Hamid Karzai and the Taliban, al-Zawahiri responded that the Saudi efforts pointed out "the historical role of saboteur played by the House of Saud in ruining the causes of the Muslim ummah, and how they represent the agents whom the Crusader West uses to disperse the ummah`s energy."
        
        The al Qaeda leadership has nowhere to go if circumstances become untenable for them in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Caught between U.S., Pakistani and Saudi forces, the last thing al Qaeda wants is to lose local support from the Taliban. In other words, Pakistan is their final battleground, and any threat to their continued haven in Pakistan poses a clear and present danger to the organization - especially if the Saudis can play a pivotal role in persuading the Taliban in Afghanistan also to turn against them. Leveraging its successes against the al Qaeda franchises in Saudi Arabia and Iraq, Riyadh also is working closely with governments to combat the jihadists in places like Yemen as well as Pakistan and Afghanistan. It is, in effect, a global Saudi campaign against jihadism, and we believe al Qaeda has no choice but to attempt to derail the Saudi effort in Pakistan and Afghanistan. There is not much al Qaeda can do to counter Saudi financial tools, but the militant group is in a position to hit back hard on the ideological front in order to counter any Saudi attempt to moderate and rehabilitate jihadists. As noted above, we have seen al Qaeda launch a sustained stream of ideological attacks in an attempt to undercut the Islamic credentials of the Saudi monarch and the Saudi clerical establishment. Another avenue that al Qaeda can take to interfere with the Saudi charm offensive is to strike Saudi targets - not only to punish the Saudis, but also to try to drive a wedge between the Saudis and the Pakistanis. Al Qaeda`s military capabilities have been greatly degraded since 2001, and with the remnant of its Saudi franchise fleeing to Yemen, it likely has very little ability to make a meaningful strike inside the kingdom. However, the one place where the al Qaeda core has shown the ability to strike in recent years is Pakistan. Mustafa Abu al-Yazid, the group`s operational commander in Afghanistan and Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the bombing of the Danish Embassy in Islamabad and for the , and we have no reason to doubt his claims. Also, an attack against a diplomatic mission in Pakistan that represents a regime considered an enemy of the jihadists is not unprecedented. In addition to the Danish Embassy bombing and several attacks against U.S. diplomatic facilities and personnel in Pakistan, al Qaeda also bombed the Egyptian Embassy in Islamabad in November 1995. According to al-Zawahiri, the Egyptian Embassy was targeted because it "was not only running a campaign for chasing Arabs in Pakistan but also spying on the Arab Mujahedeen."
        
        Based on the totality of these circumstances - Saudi activities against al Qaeda in South Asia and elsewhere, the al Qaeda perception of the Saudis as a threat and al Qaeda`s operational ability in Pakistan - we believe there is a very real threat that Saudi interests in Pakistan might be attacked in the near future.

    textlede: Night duels on Saudi streets
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        The young men start gathering around midnight on a broad strip of highway between the desert and the sea. By 1 a.m., there are hundreds of them, standing in clusters alongside their cars, glancing around uneasily for the police.
        
        Then, with a scream of revving engines, it begins: A yellow Corvette and a red Mitsubishi go head to head, racing down the road at terrifying speeds, just inches apart. Shouts go up from the sidelines, and another pair of racers shoots down the road, and another.
        
        This may be the most popular sport of Saudi youth, an obsessive, semi-legal competition that dominates weekend nights here. It ranges from garden-variety drag racing to "drifting," an extremely dangerous practice in which drivers deliberately spin out and skid sideways at high speeds, sometimes killing themselves and spectators.
        
        For Saudi Arabia's vast and underemployed generation of young people, these reckless night battles are a kind of collective scream of frustration, a rare outlet for exuberance in an ultraconservative country where the sexes are rigorously segregated and most public entertainment is illegal. They are, almost literally, bored out of their minds.
        
        "Why do they do it?" said Suhail Janoudi, 27, a sales clerk who was watching the races from the roadside with a faint smile around 1:30 a.m.
        
        "Because they have nothing else to do. Because they are empty."
        
        Some young people, asked why they risked their lives this way, said it was because of "tufush," a colloquial Arabic word whose meaning is said to derive from the gestures made by a drowning man, and which is translated roughly as idleness and desperation.
        
        Drifting, which tends to attract poorer, more marginal men, has also been at the center of an unlikely nexus between homosexuality, crime and jihadism since it emerged 30 years ago. Homoerotic desire is a constant theme in Saudi songs and poems about drifting, and accomplished drifters are said to have their pick of the prettiest boys among the spectators.
        
        Drugs sometimes play a role. But several drifters have become Islamic militants, including Youssef al-Ayyeri, the founder of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, who fought in Afghanistan and was killed by security forces in Saudi Arabia in 2003.
        
        "The idea behind drifting is: the economy and society don't need you," said Pascal Menoret, an anthropologist who did four years of field work in Riyadh, the capital, and is now teaching at Princeton and writing a book on Saudi youth culture.
        
        "They are mostly young Bedouins who recently moved to the city and whose lives are marked by suffering and self-destructive behavior."
        
        But most racers are more like young men almost anywhere: restless, thrill-seeking and madly in love with cars.
        
        "It's implanted in you when you're a kid and it stays with you," said Sulayman al-Shulukhi, 29, who races every weekend night and has adopted a 1950s greaser look: slicked-back hair, polo shirt with the collar up, jeans and white shoes.
        
        He proudly showed off the modifications he has made to his Subaru Impreza: a carbon fiber spoiler, an intake valve, a special ventilation system, a turbocharger. He then jumped in the car for a ride along one of the racing strips near King Road, not far from Jidda's Red Sea coast.
        
        "We get up to 120 kilometers per hour on this part," about 75 miles an hour, he said as he accelerated down a perilously short trip of highway, "and 200 on this next one."
        
        As he drove, Shulukhi narrated a tale of a recent accident on the road in which a friend's car had caught on fire during a race, and another one in which a driver had spun out of control and died after his car burst into flames. His world is full of driving disasters and driving heroes, some of them local men. He frequently invokes the racing movies "The Fast and the Furious," its sequels and "Death Race."
        
        Later, when the roads have emptied out a bit, it is time for some drifting. Raif Mansour al-Dammas, a skinny 21-year-old who looks much younger, gets into his beat-up white 1980s Nissan and revs the engine until white smoke pours out. Admiring shouts go up from a cluster of young men.
        
        The car leaps forward, accelerating furiously, and breaks into a sudden skid, spinning around, nearly colliding with a concrete barrier and leaving thick black marks on the pavement. A stifling smell of burned rubber hangs in the air.
        
        Standing nearby, Shulukhi explained that he and his friends, who all race Subarus, were not really drifters. The distinction is more about social status than activity; he and his friends are mostly middle class and do not see themselves as outlaws.
        
        "That's a different path from what we're doing," he said.
        
        "That's crazy, forbidden stuff."
        
        Shulukhi mentions the famous case of Faisal al-Otaibi, 27, a drifter who was sentenced to death after his car crashed during a joy ride in 2005, killing three teenage boys he had taken along with him. The sentence was reduced this year to 3,000 lashes, 20 years in prison and a lifetime driving ban.
        
        Since the arrest of Otaibi, who is known in the Saudi news media as Abu Kab (meaning, roughly, the guy with the baseball cap), the Saudi police have cracked down on drifting, treating all deaths that result from the practice as criminally negligent homicides.
        
        But even drag racing is dangerous, and, despite its prevalence in Saudi cities, the police try to discourage it.
        
        Just after 1:30, a group of police cars shows up, lights flashing. The officers do not arrest anyone. They just step out of their cars and begin talking to the young men in a paternal manner, urging them to go home.
        
        "We have another place we go when this happens," Shulukhi said confidently, getting into his Impreza and driving a few blocks to a shopping center parking lot. There, scores of other young men are waiting by their cars, some examining their engines.
        
        At 2:30, the police show up again, the next step in a game of cat and mouse that lasts much of the night.
        
        This time, Shulukhi and his friends drive north, stopping for coffee at a drive-through called French Roast, until they reach their ace in the hole: a dark strip of highway just outside the city with a construction site on one side and desert on the other. They drag-race their Subarus for another hour or so.
        
        About 5 a.m., the road begins to fill up with delivery trucks. The racers decide to call it a night, and drive reluctantly home.

    textlede: On dark Saudi streets, boredom leads to speed
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        The young men start gathering around midnight, on a broad strip of highway between the desert and the sea. By 1 a.m., there are hundreds of them, standing in clusters alongside their cars, glancing around uneasily for the police.
        
        Then, with a scream of revving engines, it begins: A yellow Corvette and a red Mitsubishi go head to head, racing down the road at terrifying speeds, just inches apart. Shouts go up from the sidelines, and another pair of racers shoots down the road, and another.
        
        This may be the most popular sport of Saudi youth, an obsessive, semilegal competition that dominates weekend nights here. It ranges from garden-variety drag racing to "drifting," an extremely dangerous practice in which drivers deliberately spin out and skid sideways at high speeds, sometimes killing themselves and spectators.
        
        For Saudi Arabia's vast and underemployed generation of young people, these reckless night battles are a kind of collective scream of frustration, a rare outlet for exuberance in an ultraconservative country where the sexes are rigorously segregated and most public entertainment is illegal. They are, almost literally, bored out of their minds.
        
        "Why do they do it?" said Suhail Janoudi, a 27-year-old sales clerk who was watching the races from the roadside with a faint smile around 1:30 a.m.
        
        "Because they have nothing else to do. Because they are empty."
        
        Some young people, asked why they risked their lives this way, said it was because of "tufush," a colloquial Arabic word whose meaning is said to derive from the gestures made by a drowning man, and which is translated roughly as idleness and desperation.
        
        Drifting, which tends to attract poorer, more marginal men, has also been an unlikely nexus between homosexuality, crime and jihadism since it emerged 30 years ago. Homoerotic desire is a constant theme in Saudi songs and poems about drifting, and accomplished drifters are said to have their pick of the prettiest boys among the spectators.

They drag-race their Subarus along a quarter-mile strip for another hour or so.
        
        About 5 a.m., the road begins to fill up with delivery trucks driven by Pakistani immigrants, doing the kind of low-wage job most Saudi men refuse to take. The racers decide to call it a night, and they drive reluctantly home.
