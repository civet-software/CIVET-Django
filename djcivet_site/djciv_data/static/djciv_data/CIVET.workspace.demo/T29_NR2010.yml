        FULL TEXT
        
        The plot to blow up a Northwest Airlines flight over American soil on Christmas Day represents an ominously new and lethal ability by a branch of Al Qaeda to attack the United States directly, according to government and independent counterterrorism specialists.
        
        Until now, American officials have expressed concern about the ability of Qaeda affiliates in North Africa, Yemen and Iraq and of a militant Islamist group in Somalia closely tied to Al Qaeda to attack American and other Western targets in their regions. But they remained confident that those groups - unlike Al Qaeda in Pakistan, led by Osama bin Laden - could not threaten the United States itself.
        
        That assessment has changed, as American intelligence officials say Qaeda operatives in Yemen trained and equipped a 23-year-old Nigerian man to evade airport security measures and ignite a powerful explosive on a commercial airliner. Four months ago, a suicide bomber from the same group, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, using a similar explosive, nearly killed a top Saudi counterterrorism minister.
        
        "Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has grown in confidence and seems to be developing a capability beyond the other Al Qaeda nodes," said Richard Barrett, a British former intelligence officer who now monitors Al Qaeda and the Taliban for the United Nations and who visited Yemen two weeks ago.
        
        Coming at the same time the United States was pouring 30,000 more troops into Afghanistan and increasing pressure on Pakistan to eliminate Al Qaeda's top leaders and sanctuary in Pakistan's tribal areas, the thwarted attack on an Amsterdam-to-Detroit flight underscored the need of the administration of President Barack Obama to defend the United States from attacks conceived in multiple havens abroad.
        
        "This is the canary in the coal mine," said Juan Carlos Zarate, a top counterterrorism official under President George W. Bush.
        
        "Al Qaeda's regional satellites are seen as platforms for Al Qaeda's global agenda."
        
        Last month, U.S. government officials unsealed terrorism-related charges against men they said were important actors in a recruitment effort that led about 20 young Americans to join the Shabab, a violent insurgent group in Somalia with ties to Al Qaeda. Law enforcement officials fear that the recruits, who hold American passports, could be tapped to return to the United States to carry out attacks there, though so far there has been no evidence of such plots.
        
        Al Qaeda's affiliate in North Africa has carried out a string of killings, bombings and kidnappings against Westerners and African security forces in recent months that have raised fears that the Algerian-based group may be taking a deadlier turn.
        
        "We think of core Al Qaeda in Pakistan as a very potent group, but not huge," said Daniel L. Byman, a former intelligence analyst now at Georgetown University.
        
        "But if you add the affiliates that are actively targeting us, it becomes a much bigger number."
        
        Al Qaeda's ties with its affiliates play out at different levels. This year, American officials began seeing the first evidence that dozens of fighters from Pakistan, along with a handful of the terrorist group's midlevel leaders, were moving to Somalia and Yemen. The terrorist groups in all three locations are now communicating more frequently and apparently are trying to coordinate their actions, the officials said.
        
        "Al Qaeda in the tribal areas - Al Qaeda central - gives strategic guidance to its regional affiliates," said an American counterterrorism official, who spoke anonymously because he was not authorized to discuss the group publicly.
        
        "It's not a hands-on, day-to-day, tactical relationship."
        
        To be sure, American and European counterterrorism experts say the ability and expertise of the Qaeda satellites are still limited. A report by Dutch counterterrorism specialists issued Wednesday, for example, concluded that the planning and preparation for the failed attack against the Northwest Airlines flight had been "fairly professional, but its execution was amateurish."
        
        And the groups' effectiveness often hinges on the personalities of their leaders. The death in 2006 of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, coincided with the decline of that group's influence in Iraq.
        
        By design as well as necessity, the plots hatched by Al Qaeda's regional affiliates are typically smaller and less spectacular than, say, Al Qaeda's failed plans to blow up several airliners over the Atlantic in 2006.
        
        But in setting their sights lower and relying on lone suicide bombers, rather than complicated plots with several confederates, these Qaeda affiliates may also pose a threat that is harder to thwart, as the Christmas Day incident demonstrated.
        
        The threat from Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula - the combination of Yemeni and Saudi operatives announced in January - has drawn increasing attention from American officials. The group has carried out several attacks against foreign embassies and Yemeni officials in the past two years, adding to security threats in Yemen that include an armed rebellion in the north and a secessionist movement in the south.
        
        As the United States and Yemen have increased their counterterrorism cooperation in recent months, the Qaeda affiliate has sharpened its rhetorical attacks against the United States. In the latest issue of Sada Al Malahim, the Internet magazine of the Qaeda affiliate in Yemen, the group's leader, Nasser al-Wuhayshi, urged his followers to use small bombs "in airports in the Western crusade countries that participated in the war against Muslims; or on their planes, or in their residential complexes or their subways."
        
        A Qaeda operative in Yemen eulogized fellow militants killed in a Dec. 17 airstrike against an insurgent training camp in Abyan Province in southern Yemen.
        
        In a video recording of the speech several days after the strike, the speaker said his fight was not against Yemeni soldiers, only against Americans: "We are carrying a bomb to hit the enemies of God. O soldiers, you should learn that we do not want to fight you, nor do we have an issue with you," according to a translation by IntelCenter, a terrorism research company.
        
        "We only have an issue with America and its agents. So, be careful not to side with America."
        
        In airstrikes facilitated by the United States this month, Yemeni officials said they had made targets of the leader, Mr. Wuhayshi, and his deputy, Said Ali al-Shihri, who were believed to be meeting with Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born radical cleric linked to the suspect in the November shooting at Fort Hood in Texas.
        
        Relatives of the cleric say he is still alive, and senior American officials said Wednesday that they were still trying to determine which, if any, of the top Yemeni militant leaders had been killed or wounded in that attack.

        As a prisoner at Guantanamo, Said Ali al-Shihri said he wanted freedom so he could go home to Saudi Arabia and work at his family s furniture store. Instead, al-Shihri, who was released in 2007 under the Bush administration, is now deputy leader of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, a group that has claimed responsibility for the Christmas Day attempted bomb attack on a Detroit-bound airliner.
        
        His potential involvement in the terrorist plot has raised new opposition to releasing Guantanamo Bay inmates, complicating President Obama s pledge to close the military prison in Cuba. It also highlights the challenge of identifying the hard-core militants as the administration decides what to do with the remaining 198 prisoners. Stories on anti-terror measures, A1.

    textlede: UN blacklists Yemeni al-Qaeda group
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        The United Nations security council has added the Yemen-based Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to its list of outlawed organisations. Two of the group's purported leaders, Nasser al-Wahayshi and Qasim al-Raymi, also face new restrictions after the move by the international body's sanctions committee on Tuesday.
        
        Among the sanctions against the two men, who were among 23 fighters who escaped from a jail in Sanaa in 2006, were worldwide freezes on their assets and travel bans. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claims to have been behind the failed attempt to blow up a Detriot-bound airliner on Christmas Day as well as other attacks inside Yemen and Saudi Arabia.
        
        "Today's actions strengthen international efforts to degrade the capabilities of AQAP," Susan Rice, the US ambassador to the United Nations, said. 'Dismantle and defeat' The UN committee made its decision the day after the US state department added the al-Qaeda group to it list of proscribed organisations.
        
        "We are determined to eliminate AQAP's ability to execute violent attacks and to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat their networks," Philip Crowley, a state department spokesman, said. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was formed in January 2009 after the merger of groups in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. It has since set up bases inside Yemen and has been blamed for the suicide attack on South Korean tourists in March 2009 and an attempt to assassinate the Saudi deputy interior minister across the border in neighbouring Saudi Arabia. Yemen has bolsetered its troops in three of the country's provinces in an attempt to tackle al-Qaeda and has carried out a number of air raids, which it claims have left dozens of fighters dead. Al-Raymi was among a number of senior al-Qaeda figures reported to have been killed in a Yemeni attack on two vehicles on Friday. The government in Sanaa is also battling so-called Houthi rebels in the north and a secessionist movement in the south.

    textlede: Interview: Richard Barrett
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        The failed Christmas Day airliner attack has resuscitated fears of terrorism in the US. But that fear is no longer focused on Afghanistan, where 68,000 US troops are stationed, or on Iraq, with 120,000 US troops. For now the focus has switched to Yemen. Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian man accused of trying to blow up the US airliner bound for Detroit, had spent the few months before the attack in Yemen and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has claimed responsibility for the attempted attack.
        
        Four months ago, a suicide bomber from the same group, using a similar explosive, nearly killed a top Saudi counterterrorism minister. Former British intelligence official, Richard Barrett, the UN's highest ranking official responsible for monitoring the activities of al-Qaeda and the Taliban, tells Al Jazeera, that AQAP is the most dangerous of al-Qaeda's regional offshoots and that its mission is to destabilise the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. He recently spoke with Al Jazeera. Al Jazeera: How strong is AQAP compared with al-Qaeda's presence in Afghanistan and Pakistan? Richard Barrett: AQAP has until recently focused on targets in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and may continue to do so. But the attempt to bring down an aircraft over Detroit on December 25 shows that, where the means exist, AQAP may also launch attacks outside the region. It remains to be seen whether they have the capacity to do so on a continuing basis. AQAP, however, is like the other al-Qaeda affiliates in that its main objectives are local. Al-Qaeda in Iraq is now a marginal group which is as unlikely as it ever was to have any meaningful influence over the political process there. It still appears to be sectarian and backward looking, apparently now working with ex-Baathists.
        
        Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has been increasingly pushed to the ungoverned areas of Southern Algeria and Northern Mali and has not managed to get active operational supporters in Europe. Its agenda remains local. Al-Shabab in Somalia claim allegiance to al-Qaeda, but the al-Qaeda leadership has not recognised this and the fight in Somalia seems to have remained, so far, local and tribal. The al-Qaeda leadership in the Afghan/Pakistan border area is constrained by military action and is not in a position to plan and mount major attacks. So my conclusion is that compared to the even weaker state of other parts of al-Qaeda, AQAP is currently probably its strongest part. You recently said al-Qaeda operatives hiding in Yemen are the most dangerous ...
        
        I do believe they are very dangerous - they are young, they are hotheaded and of course as the Saudi Arabian authorities have being successful in pushing al-Qaeda supporters out of Saudi Arabia, they have tended to go to Yemen and join with Yemenis there who are keen to support their attacks in Saudi Arabia over the border. And that area there is difficult for the Yemenis to control and the Yemenis of course have a great deal on their hands with the rebellion in the North and the separatist movement in the South, with all the economic and social problems they face in addition. Has the government of Yemen done enough to combat AQAP? Should the international community have done more to stop the growing threat AQAP poses in Yemen? The Yemeni authorities have a lot of problems on their plate and it is very difficult to deal with because, of course, they need to have the cooperation of the tribes to deal with it. But I think the involvement of the international community inside Yemen is a delicate issue that the Yemenis should be fully in control of - so maybe we should have responded more to Yemeni requests for assistance and I see that the US and the European Union have increased their support for Yemen over recent months which suggests perhaps they could have done this earlier. I am not sure Yemen sees it as such a threat - certainly not as much as the rest of the world does following the December 25 attempt. But I think the international community was very well aware of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the threat it could be posing. And of course Saudi Arabia in particular was because it was made up of Saudis and their objectives were to attack targets in Saudi Arabia. Why is Saudi Arabia their main target? Saudi Arabia is the heartland for al-Qaeda. It has always been a target for them. I think it is both the Western dependence on Saudi Arabian oil but also the alliance between Saudi Arabia and the West, which is very strong, and I think what the al-Qaeda people see is that if they could attack the economic infrastructure in Saudi Arabia they would be achieving two aims: that is weakening the West but also weakening the authorities in Saudi Arabia which, of course, they don't support at all. Do you think al-Qaeda remains a global threat? Al-Qaeda is still very determined that's the thing. I think they are very weakened and they have been unable to mount big operations as they would like to but it's still a threat.
        
        And the leadership in the Afghan-Pakistan border area is still very very keen to link up with people elsewhere in the world who it can persuade and help to mount major attacks. And what the al-Qaeda leadership would like to do is to establish some sort of control over their operations to make it more strategic rather than these sort of small attacks as they occur at the moment. Are they succeeding? I don't think they are. They remain under a great deal of pressure. There is this threat that the al-Qaeda leadership could link up with people who can travel easily to other countries to commit attacks. And it's difficult for authorities to maintain watch over all these people. Although we have been successful in stopping attacks over the last couple of years, major attacks, perhaps also we've been lucky. Which enemy should be the greater priority for the US in Afghanistan: the Taliban or al-Qaeda? I think for the US they've made it clear that al-Qaeda is the greatest enemy and their attacks on the Taliban seem to follow their desire to defeat al-Qaeda. In my opinion I think that's probably right. Clearly there's a great design in the international community to ensure that al-Qaeda doesn't have any safe havens from which to attack and operate, whether locally or elsewhere. The question is whether the Taliban would give them these safe havens if they controlled in any sustainable way territory in Afghanistan or even the whole country. But generally speaking I think that the Afghan Taliban have made it absolutely clear, if we believe them, that they are only interested in the future of Afghanistan and not in disturbing the future of their neighbours or indeed any other country. Will the inversion of the groups' traditional power dynamic lead to better or worse relations? I think that the relations are obviously very well established over many years, we have to accept that. And these people are very used to one another and to a certain extent share some objectives - you know what they think is the right sort of government and what they don't like in the sense of outside influences.
        
        But essentially as the Taliban come closer, if they do, to some sort of political accommodation with the rest of the Afghan community, then they will find the weight of al-Qaeda around their necks - or the perception that al-Qaeda remains around their necks - a hindrance and this will probably lead to some sort of tensions and I am hoping that certainly that will be true.
        
        And al-Qaeda has made it very clear that their battle is a global one whereas the Taliban have made it clear their battle is a local one. I think also we've seen some differences of opinion because al-Qaeda are very much interested in attacking Pakistani troops and Pakistani targets as are the Pakistan Taliban people they work with. As for the Afghan Taliban, they have always made it clear that that's not their objective, that they believe the battle is against foreign forces and the Karzai government in Afghanistan and that it has nothing to do with the Pakistani forces or army. The Saudi Arabian government maintains that the Taliban would become moderate in due course. Do you agree? I think what the Taliban will become is perhaps more sophisticated and more practiced in government. I think that when they were running the country before - or large parts of it before - I don't think they were very sophisticated and I think were still very much in a learning stage and really in a developmental stage and they weren't quite clear what their policies should be. I hope they learn from that. The trouble to me is that now for many many years - for over a generation - the Afghan people have known nothing but conflict and it will be very difficult for everybody to settle down in a sort of peaceful, civilian type government. Is capturing Osama bin Laden the key to defeating al-Qaeda? I am not sure it's the key to defeating al-Qaeda, I am not even sure it will make a big difference to al-Qaeda. Certainly Osama bin laden has remained an inspirational character though I don't think he has much operational control over what al-Qaeda does. Whether he was imprisoned, dead, hiding in those remote areas in Pakistan/Afghanistan, I am not sure what difference it will make. What we have to do is to ensure that the global community understands that what al-Qaeda offers is purely destructive, negative, a hopeless philosophy and if we want progress, security and prosperity then the last people we should be looking to to help us is al-Qaeda. They offer nothing but further disadvantage. And it's making that clear to people that al-Qaeda lack any relevance to life today and they lack any credibility as well I think that's the main thing - that we shall do whether Osama bin Laden is captured or not.

    textlede: Yemen jets raid 'al-Qaeda hideout'
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Yemeni fighter jets have attacked the home of a suspected leader of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, as the military steps up pressure on the group. A Yemeni tribal source said a number of people had been killed in Wednesday's air raids in Erq al-Shabwan village in Maarib province.
        
        The source said the wave of raids, which began in the morning, targeted the house of Ayed al-Shabwani, one of six al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula leaders the government said were killed in an air attack last week. A military official, who would not be named, said there had been three attacks on the house and one on an orange grove near the village where the authorities think al-Shabwani had built a safe haven for dozens of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula members. Al Jazeera's Mohamed Vall reporting from Aden, said: "[The air raids] started around noon 130km east of Sanaa and the government said they have targeted the home and the farm of el-Shabani, who is one of the names that the government said has been killed last week. Al-Qaeda denied that but the government did not comment on al-Qaeda's denial.
        
        "There were four raids in that area and the government says there was an exchange of fire and that al-Qaeda members were armed with anti-aircraft weapons which they tried to use against the government aircraft but they did not talk about any al-Qaeda casualties and this time around the government has refrained from giving that kind of information."
        
        Large deployment The official said that there had been a large deployment of government troops at the city of Maarib, about 5km from Erq al-Shabwan. During the afternoon, witnesses said, jets twice fired missiles at the orange grove and afterwards continued to fly in the area. The raids come just days after Yemen said it had killed six suspected leaders, including Shabwani, of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in Saada province, north of the capital Saana. Al Jazeera's correspondent in Yemen also reported that "The Yemeni army website published news that one al-Qaeda member was killed in clashes with security forces in Lahij which is about 50km north of Aden, and they said that this took place after a government vehicle had been hijacked by al-Qaeda members and there was an exchange of fire between the two sides in which the member was killed."
        
        Yemen is under US pressure to clamp down on Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which claimed responsibility for the December 25 bid to blow up a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam as it landed in Detroit.
        
        Wednesday's air raid comes a day after the United Nations Security Council added Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to its list of outlawed organisations. Two of the group's purported leaders, Nasser al-Wahayshi and Qasim al-Raymi, face new restrictions after the move by the Security Council's sanctions committee. The sanctions against the two men, who were among 23 fighters who escaped from a jail in Sanaa in 2006, include worldwide freezes on their assets and travel bans.
        
        "Today's actions strengthen international efforts to degrade the capabilities of AQAP," Susan Rice, the US ambassador to the UN, said, referring to Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Proscribed by US The UN committee made its decision on Tuesday shortly after the US state department added the Yemen-based group to it list of proscribed organisations.
        
        "We are determined to eliminate AQAP's ability to execute violent attacks and to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat their networks," Philip Crowley, a state department spokesman, said.

    textlede: Q&A: Is Yemen the next Afghanistan?; The Nigerian who allegedly tried to blow up a Detroit-bound airliner reportedly trained in Yemen with Al Qaeda, but the regional offshoot of Al Qaeda appears to have no ties with rebels and secessionists challenging Yemen's central government.

        What is Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula?
        
        Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) is an offshoot of Al Qaeda that operates in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. The group was formed in January 2009 when the branches of Al Qaeda operating in Yemen and Saudi Arabia joined under the leadership of Nasser Abdel Karim al-Wahishi, a Yemeni national who is suspected of having close ties with the Al Qaeda network led by Osama bin Laden.
        
        AQAP's organization is thought to be largely based in the eastern Yemeni provinces of Abyan and Shabwa, with some cells suspected of operating in the oil producing province of Marib.
        
        The Al Qaeda in Yemen organization claimed credit for the September 2008 bombing of the US Embassy in Sanaa in which 10 Yemeni guards and four civilians were killed.
        
        AQAP claimed credit for two suicide attacks in Yemen in 2009. AQAP launched its first attack outside Yemen in August 2009 when a suicide bomber targeted Saudi Arabia's head of internal security, Prince Muhammad bin Nayef. AQAP claimed credit for the recent attempted bombing of the Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Detroit.
        
        Christopher Boucek, at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote in a report released in September 2009 that, "[T]here are increasing indications that Al Qaeda is regrouping in Yemen and preparing to strike at Western and other targets. Recent counterterrorism measures in Saudi Arabia have forced extremists to seek refuge elsewhere, and analysts have observed a steady flow relocating to Yemen's under-governed areas."
        
        What is AQAP's relationship to other militant groups in Yemen?
        
        The group, as yet, appears to have no operational ties with the northern rebels or southern secessionists that are challenging Yemen's central government. In May 2009, AQAP did, however, announce its support for the secession movement in southern Yemen, where many southerners are angry with President Ali Abdullah Saleh, accusing him of diverting economic resources to the north of the country.
        
        But there is no evidence of AQAP involvement. Many in the Southern Movement, an umbrella group for southern secessionists that seek to reverse the 1990 unification that absorbed the communist south, retain socialist views that are anathema to the militant ideology of Al Qaeda.
        
        Some analysts have suggested that the attempt to link AQAP with the southern secessionists is motivated by a desire to delegitimize the secessionists. The development of ties between Houthi rebels in the north and Al Qaeda is less likely. The Houthis are Shiites and Sunni Al Qaeda considers them apostates.
        
        What role have ex-Guantánamo detainees played in AQAP?
        
        Said Ali al-Shihri, an ex-Guantánamo detainee who was released into the custody of Saudi officials in 2007, appeared in a propaganda video for AQAP in early 2009 that proclaimed him the group's second in command. Mr. Shihri was released after attending Saudi Arabia's reeducation program for Islamic militants and resurfaced in Yemen.
        
        Another former prisoner at Guantánamo, Mohammed Atiq al-Harbi (also known as Muhammed al-Awfi) appeared in the same video. Reuters reports that 1 in 5 detainees released from Guantánamo has joined a militant group, according to a classified Pentagon report.
        
        How effective has the Yemeni government been at combating militants?
        
        The Yemeni government's record on fighting Al Qaeda elements in the country is mixed. AQAP's leader, Mr. Wahishi, was one of 23 suspected Al Qaeda members who managed to escape from a high-security prison. Also among the escapees was Jamal al-Badawi, convicted of helping to plan the 2000 attack on the USS Cole in the Port of Aden. President Saleh's government has often pursued a policy of appeasement, providing Islamic militants with amnesties, though crackdowns have often followed.
        
        The Yemeni government has a history of making use of Islamic militants. For example, in the 1994 civil war with South Yemen, the Saleh government used "Afghan Arabs" - men who fought with the mujahideen against the Soviets in Afghanistan - against southern secessionists.
        
        What is the likely outcome of increased US military aid in Yemen?
        
        Yemen's domestic situation complicates any US efforts to defeat AQAP in Yemen. Among the most serious challenges are government corruption and increasing antigovernment sentiment among large swaths of the Yemeni population. In 2009, Transparency International ranked Yemen 154th out of 180 countries for government corruption.
        
        Pat Lang, former head of the Middle East desk at the Defense Intelligence Agency, who also served as defense attaché in Sanaa in the early 1980s, says that limited US military involvement is useful in keeping the Al Qaeda problem there tamped down.
        
        "We ought to provide them with enough materiel and money to keep them active in the field, and keep our special ops people chasing around people we don't like," he says.
        
        But he adds that a major escalation would be a mistake.
        
        "The only thing you'd do by introducing conventional forces there is uniting more people against us and in anger at the central government."
        
        Yemen's other challenges include water scarcity and an ailing economy.
        
        "The country's deteriorating security is a result of problems unrelated to security," Carnegie's Boucek wrote, arguing that an integrated package of development aid "can better address the interconnected challenges facing Yemen than can military and security aid."
        
        How does Yemen differ from Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan?
        
        Yemen differs in a number of important ways. While Yemenis are largely conservative Muslims, support for militant Islam isn't as widespread as in Pakistan and Afghanistan. In many parts of Yemen, tribal allegiances often take precedence over religious affiliations. Though Yemen is an impoverished country with limited infrastructure and a corrupt government, it is not as lawless as Afghanistan.

    textlede: University symbolizes Yemen's complications; Al Eman, seen as a place of jihadist ideas, tries to meld Islam and the West
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Al Eman University, founded by Sheik Abdul Majid al-Zindani, tries to meld Islam and Western disciplines but is seen by some as a center for jihadist ideas.
        
        FULL TEXT
        
        The mosque at Al Eman University is larger than a football field, an immense warehouse with breeze-block walls, a tin roof and industrial lighting. On Fridays, more than 4,000 men come to pray, lining up along the marks on the figured green carpet, giving each enough room to prostrate himself toward Mecca.
        
        The devotions of such a crowd are a powerful message of faith and solidarity. Most are dressed in national costume, white robes and embroidered shawls for Yemenis and Arabs, tribal robes for some Africans, crocheted prayer caps for the Asians.
        
        This university, the size of a village, was founded in 1993 by Sheik Abdul Majid al-Zindani, a revered spiritual leader, theological adviser to Osama bin Laden and co-founder of the main Yemeni opposition party, Islah. In 2004, the United States Treasury put Sheik Zindani on a list of "specially designated global terrorists" on suspicion of fund-raising for Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. The university itself is a good symbol of the complications of Yemen, its need to strike a balance between conservative Islam and an increased American involvement.
        
        The radical American-born Internet preacher Anwar al-Awlaki took classes and gave lectures here in 2004 and 2005, when a young Nigerian, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab - who now faces charges of trying to blow up an airliner over Detroit on Dec. 25 - was in Sana studying Arabic. There is no firm evidence that they met then, or even last summer, when Mr. Abdulmutallab returned before heading off to Qaeda training camps, where he probably did meet Mr. Awlaki; the school denies that they ever met here.
        
        John Walker Lindh, the American who was captured fighting for the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001, studied here before fighting the Americans, and in general the university is seen as a center for jihadist ideas. While the school says lectures are only for students, the mosque is open to all Muslims.
        
        The university has more than 4,000 students and teaches courses in Islam and Western disciplines, sometimes trying to meld the two. Sheik Zindani, thought to be 59 and favoring a long, dyed beard, is well known for his effort to prove that the Koran predicts Western scientific discoveries, and he has claimed to have cured AIDS. One of his books, translated shakily into English, with charts about the ruminant stomach of the cow, photosynthesis and other scientific discoveries, is called "Signs & Mericals [sic] of Prophet Messenger, Peace be Upon Him."
        
        Hood Abu Ras, who runs Sheik Zindani's university office, denies that Mr. Abdulmutallab was ever here, or that anything happens at Al Eman except scholarship.
        
        "Has the U.S. ever produced any evidence of Sheik Zindani's involvement in terror?" Mr. Abu Ras asked. As for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, an alliance of Saudi and Yemeni Qaeda operatives, he said, "It gets more propaganda than it deserves."
        
        The sheik himself, at a recent news conference, said he opposed foreign forces in Yemen.
        
        "We accept any cooperation in the framework of respect and joint interests, and we reject military occupation of our country," he said, adding: "Yemen's rulers and people must be careful before a guardianship is imposed on them" by foreigners.
        
        He was blunter in Friday Prayer at another mosque, when he warned of an American plot to occupy Yemen, based on a London conference scheduled for Jan. 28 whose stated subject is Afghanistan.
        
        "The U.K. request for an international conference on Yemen is meant to pave the way for a U.N. Security Council resolution to approve an occupation of Yemen and to put it under a U.N. mandate," Sheik Zindani said, as the worshipers shouted, "No to occupation!" He said that Washington's "so-called war on terror is in fact a war against Islam," according to Al Jazeera.
        
        After his sermon, he told a reporter for Al Jazeera: "Obama's advisers recommended that if Yemen becomes a failed state, they have to occupy the oil resources and Yemen's seacoast. What is this military buildup on our coasts for? Is it really justified by piracy? No one really believes that."
        
        Sheik Zindani is no fan of American involvement in the Muslim world and has defended jihad - beginning with the thousands of Muslims, many of them from Yemen, who heeded the call, as he did, to fight the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. Their alliance with the Taliban then was considered a fine thing, and Mr. bin Laden himself fought the Soviets.
        
        But the reaction to Afghanistan, including the creation of Al Qaeda, has hit Yemen, too. Sheik Zindani, who has considerable political and moral weight, has come out against terrorism, if not jihad, and President Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen has failed to get Washington to remove the sheik from the terrorist list. Even a senior Western diplomat said that the sheik "has kept his head down for the last few years," since he took legal action against Yemeni newspapers and journalists in 2006 for reprinting even censored parts of the Danish cartoons of Muhammad.
        
        Mr. Saleh, who has run Yemen for 31 years, told The New York Times in June 2008 that ruling here is like "dancing with snakes."
        
        Sheik Zindani and his conservative brand of Islam - Yemeni Salafism - has strong support from Saudi Arabia and one of Mr. Saleh's oldest allies, Ali Mohsen. They are all pillars of the current government, even if Mr. Mohsen opposes the dynastic succession of Mr. Saleh's son, Ahmed, to the presidency.
        
        While Yemeni Salafism is not as militant as the Saudi variety, Wahhabism, Sheik Zindani studied in Saudi Arabia, and the mental landscape of the Salafis and Al Qaeda is very similar - conservative, anti-Western, devoted to purifying Islam and returning to the practices they believe existed at the time of Prophet Muhammad.
        
        Mr. Mohsen, a general who is currently prosecuting the war against a Houthi rebellion in the north, also recruited thousands of Yemenis to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan. His brigades returned victorious, and Mr. Saleh has used them since to help defeat the south in the 1994 civil war and against the Houthis. Some fighters, of course, have migrated to Al Qaeda, and there are imams here more radical than Sheik Zindani.
        
        When North and South Yemen were united in 1990, Sheik Zindani accepted Mr. Saleh's rule and was granted this huge area of government land on the western edge of Sana for the university - adjoining a large military base, which is Mr. Mohsen's headquarters. There are rumors that students sometimes get military training there, which Mr. Abu Ras also denies.
        
        Tuition, housing and food are free for students, and there is a primary school for their children. But with the Treasury Department crackdown on financing groups suspected of terrorism, Yemeni analysts say that the school now has less money, that the number of students is down at least 2,000 and that there is less food in the cafeteria.
        
        Ismail al-Suhailyi, who has taught political science here for 13 years, said that the West must concentrate on economic development, not just security assistance.
        
        "Otherwise, the people will see their government working only for the interests of the Americans," he said.
        
        "Al Qaeda is part of Yemen, but they are just a few hundred people," Mr. Suhailyi said, advocating further dialogue with Al Qaeda.
        
        "I hope the American government will work to solve the problems here, and not become part of the problem."

    textlede: Security threat boosts U.S. action in Yemen; Administration opposes republic's offer to negotiate with al-Qaeda
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Experienced fighters returning to Yemen from the Iraq war and radicalized U.S. citizens who have taken up residence in that country have broadened assessments of the threat posed by the al-Qaeda affiliate there, according to administration and congressional officials.
        
        In addition to flooding Yemen with intelligence resources, the United States has stepped up military strikes from the air against al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and pressed the Yemeni government, which has offered to negotiate with the group, to toughen its approach.
        
        As Yemen's foreign minister arrived in Washington this week for consultations, the State Department announced Tuesday that it had designated the al-Qaeda branch there, known as AQAP, as a foreign terrorist organization, a move that allows U.S. prosecution of those who are associated with or provide assistance to the group, which was formed only last January. A United Nations sanctions committee also announced Tuesday that it had added AQAP and its senior leaders to a U.N. blacklist that allows assets to be frozen internationally and imposes travel restrictions.
        
        An investigative report scheduled for release Wednesday by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee cites U.S. concern over as many as three dozen American citizens who converted to Islam in prison and moved to Yemen after their release in the past year. Some of them have "dropped off the radar" of U.S. and Yemeni law enforcement and may be receiving al-Qaeda training there, the report says.
        
        The report cautions that U.S. officials said they had no specific evidence of such training, but a committee staffer said that "everything related to Yemen is now being ratcheted up."
        
        As U.S. citizens, these people do not come under the purview of the CIA but are "being watched," the staffer said, by the FBI and State Department security officials attached to the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, the Yemeni capital.
        
        "U.S. officials said they are on heightened alert because of the potential threat from extremists carrying American passports and the related challenges involved in detecting and stopping homegrown operatives," the report says.
        
        An additional concern, it says, "is a group of nearly 10 non-Yemeni Americans who traveled to Yemen, converted to Islam, became fundamentalists, and married Yemeni women so they could remain in the country."
        
        One U.S. official, it reports, described them as "blond-haired, blue-eyed types" who "fit a profile of Americans whom al-Qaeda has sought to recruit over the past several years."
        
        Intelligence lapses leading to the attempted bombing of a U.S. jetliner on Christmas Day and the growing threat from Yemen will be the subject of a series of congressional hearings over the next several weeks, beginning with testimony Wednesday by Director of National Intelligence Dennis C. Blair and Michael E. Leiter, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, before the Senate Homeland Security Committee. On Thursday, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has scheduled a closed-door hearing.
        
        Administration and military officials insisted that the intensified focus on Yemen predated the embarrassing failure to prevent the attempted airplane bombing last month. They noted that White House counterterrorism chief John O. Brennan made two visits there last year and that Yemen was the subject of 15 meetings of the National Security Council "deputies committee" as well as numerous meetings of top national security officers. U.S. military counterterrorism trainers and CIA intelligence collectors on the ground there were increased last year along with the budget for such operations. Twice in December, U.S. precision-guided missiles struck al-Qaeda targets in Yemen; an additional strike took place last week.
        
        The biggest surprise of the Christmas incident, a senior administration official said, was that planning for the attack and training of the alleged bomber, Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, took place in Yemen despite the fact that "we had that place sort of blanketed, that we were working it very closely."
        
        "What Mr. Abdulmutallab demonstrates is that we need to heighten our vigilance about those who may have been in Yemen, or that the Yemeni AQAP are working with abroad," including U.S. passport-holders, the official said. This source and military and counterterrorism officials agreed to discuss the still-volatile policy and intelligence situation in Yemen only on the condition of anonymity.
        
        "Individuals who are working this issue need to be in place in Yemen," the official said of the growing U.S. presence there.
        
        "We do not have [military] boots on the ground and we have no intention \.\.\. of having boots on the ground. But we want to make sure that we have the expertise and capabilities that can work with the Yemenis to provide them with the wherewithal and the capacity that they need."
        
        The official expressed frustration at a recent offer by Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh to negotiate with AQAP leaders who agree to lay down their arms.
        
        "Al-Qaeda is an organization to be destroyed, not to be negotiated with in any manner," he said. The administration would "continue to press the Yemenis to defeat al-Qaeda, not to talk with them."
        
        Officials are "mindful" to avoid inflaming the domestic situation with a heavy U.S. footprint, he said, "but there are certain near-term and immediate imperatives that we need to pursue."
        
        Brennan's conversations with Saleh and other Yemeni officials, he said, have been "pretty intense \.\.\. and rather direct in terms of what we expected the Yemenis to do vis-a-vis al-Qaeda and what we were prepared to do in the event it was not addressed \.\.\. not just collect information about them but take aggressive action to denigrate their capabilities."
        
        The December air attacks, in conjunction with Yemeni air, ground and intelligence forces, were seen as proof that the government was starting to get the message.
        
        Saleh's offer to negotiate, U.S. officials said, is based on a failure to understand that AQAP is a different breed than an earlier organization, al-Qaeda in Yemen, that was largely decimated early this decade by coordinated U.S. and Yemeni operations. The new group, whose leadership was formed by terrorists who escaped from a Yemeni prison in 2006 and Yemenis released from the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, under the Bush administration, combines al-Qaeda affiliates in both Saudi Arabia and Yemen and is bolstered by insurgents returning from Iraq with what one counterterrorism official called "battlefield expertise" and tactical knowledge.
        
        "As the Iraq conflict came down, you found that a number of those al-Qaeda types who went to Iraq to fight came back with hardened skills and new techniques," the senior administration official said.
        
        "These individuals who wanted to go and fight are now being plugged into the existing organization in Yemen," said Gregory D. Johnsen, a Yemen expert at Princeton University.
        
        "For a long time, there was no real organizational infrastructure for them to fit into. Now, there is something."

    textlede: Dozens of ex-prisoners head to Yemen after converting to Islam, alarming US officials
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        WASHINGTON - U.S. law enforcement authorities believe as many as three dozen Americans who converted to Islam in prison have travelled to Yemen, possibly to train with al-Qaida, according to a Senate report.
        
        The "radicalization" of the individuals has alarmed U.S. officials even though no evidence has tied them to terror activities. Several of the individuals have "dropped off the radar" for weeks at a time and continue to carry U.S. passports, according to a copy of the report obtained by The Associated Press.
        
        The assessment was written by staff working for Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry, a Democrat.
        
        "Al-Qaeda's recruitment tactics also have changed," Kerry wrote in an introduction to the report.
        
        "The group seeks to recruit American citizens to carry out terrorist attacks in the United States."
        
        Al-Qaida forces in Yemen have emerged in recent months as a pressing threat to U.S. security, with ties to a recent airline bombing plot and the shooting deaths of 13 people at the U.S. Army's Fort Hood post.
        
        At the United Nations in New York, the U.N. Security Council committee that handles sanctions against Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Yemen branch of the international terror network, announced that the organization and two of its leaders will be subject to binding international sanctions including freezes on assets and an international travel ban.
        
        The travel ban means the two men, Nasir al-Wahishi and Said al-Shihri, would be subject to arrest anywhere in the world. The U.S. Treasury also has imposed domestic sanctions against the Yemen organization and the two men.
        
        The White House and Pentagon have said they have no plans to send ground troops there, and Yemen has made clear it would not want them. Remaining options would include covert strikes against al-Qaida targets and increased aid to help train and equip Yemen's own security forces.
        
        Gen. David Petraeus, head of U.S. Central Command whose command territory includes Yemen, has said he would like to double military aid to that country, which currently is receiving about $67 million.
        
        Kerry's report was expected to set the stage for a Wednesday public hearing on Yemen with testimony from senior State Department officials.
        
        In addition to its finding that al-Qaida was trying actively to attract "nontraditional followers" who could penetrate U.S. security, the staff report concludes that al-Qaida has remained a viable threat.
        
        "Despite setbacks, al-Qaida is not on the run," the report concludes.
        
        Kerry's staff also cites as many as 10 non-Yemeni Americans, in addition to the nearly three dozen prisoners, who moved to Yemen, became Islamic fundamentalists and married Yemeni women to remain in the country.
        
        "Described by one American official as 'blond-haired, blue eyed-types,' these individuals fit a profile of Americans whom Al Qaeda has sought to recruit over the past several years," the report states.
        
        Tuesday's action at the United Nations was its latest of several against AQAP and the two officials. The organization has claimed responsibility for numerous terror acts targeting Saudi Arabia, Korea, Yemen and the United States since its inception in January 2009.

    textlede: Yemen raising its game on terrorism in glare of international spotlight
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Government insists al-Qaida threat is exaggerated and far from top concern, but is keen to flaunt anti-terror credentials
        
        FULL TEXT
        
        It's not easy trying to follow Yemen's fight against al-Qaida. Until a bomber tried to down a US airliner over Detroit on Christmas Day, this rugged Arabian peninsular country had attracted little attention beyond the likes of the CIA and MI6 worrying that its "ungoverned spaces" were becoming a safe haven for jihadis. Now it is in the uncomfortable glare of intense international publicity.
        
        Yemen's government insists the problem of terrorism is being exaggerated. It has tried from the start to suggest that Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian student accused of carrying out the plane attack, was rather than in Sana'a, where he was studying Arabic.
        
        Foreign journalists who have been streaming to this picturesque city since the new year are told by officials that al-Qaida is far from Yemen's biggest challenge: , unrest in the south, unemployment, illiteracy and shortages of water and oil all figure far higher on the list of national priorities. Ordinary Yemenis tend to agree.
        
        Priorities are different at the heavily guarded US embassy in the capital. The checkpoints that surround it carry fading posters of Yemeni security personnel who were "martyred", with 15 others (some of them the al-Qaida perpetrators), in a September 2008 bombing. Fears of new attacks prompted and other western missions earlier this month, apparently because of intelligence warnings. They are open again but security remains intense.
        
        In the run-up to next week's London conference on Yemen, the government here is simultaneously bending over backwards to play down the threat from al-Qaida in the Arabian peninsula (Aqap) and flaunting its own robust anti-terrorist credentials.
        
        "We understand the western mentality," quips one senior Yemeni with a smile. Not a day goes by without some new official claim of a deadly blow against the group: six men killed in air strikes on their vehicles; three more captured near the Saudi border; two more in a remote southern tribal area.
        
        The Saudis did their bit yesterday by announcing that three wanted terrorists - they use the Arabic word "deviants", with its powerful Qur'anic resonance - had been killed in Yemen in September. Mugshots of supposedly dead al-Qaida fighters are posted on Yemeni government and news websites sometimes only minutes after an air attack is over.
        
        Aqap challenges every statement made by those it scorns as "tyrants and crusaders."
        
        On Sunday it flatly denied a , the group's military leader. It even boasted that Raimi and four or five of his fellow fighters were holding a celebratory meal after their escape.
        
        The latest official boast is the capture of Said Ali al-Shihri, a Saudi who is the group's deputy leader, after he tried to bypass a roadblock in Shabwa, where tribes are said to be backing the jihadis. Shihri, a freed Guantánamo prisoner who is accused of involvement in the Sana'a embassy attack in 2008, would be a very big catch indeed. This claim may eventually turn out to be true but official credibility is so poor that western diplomats remain sceptical pending irrefutable confirmation. Too many others have proved premature or false.
        
        Aqap in any event now urges supporters not to believe anything until they hear its own version of events.
        
        "It is a sad state of affairs when one trusts Aqap's statements more than the Yemeni government's press releases," said the highly regarded Yemen watcher Gregory Johnsen on his blog.
        
        Still, there is a sense that the Yemeni government has raised its game: there is talk in Sana'a of better co-ordination between different agencies and ministries and troops being diverted from the war against the Houthi rebels in the north to concentrate on fighting al-Qaida. How long that will last - especially once current international interest has faded - is another matter.

        This university, the size of a village, was founded in 1993 by Sheik Abdul Majid al-Zindani, a revered spiritual leader, theological adviser to Osama bin Laden and co-founder of the main Yemeni opposition party, Islah. In 2004, the United States Treasury put Mr. Zindani on a list of "specially designated global terrorists" for suspected fund-raising for Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. The university itself is a good symbol of the complications of Yemen, its need to strike a balance between conservative Islam and an increased American involvement.
        
        The radical American-born Internet preacher Anwar al-Awlaki took classes and gave lectures here in 2004 and 2005, when a young Nigerian, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab -- who later tried to blow up an airliner over Detroit on Dec. 25 -- was in Sana studying Arabic. There is no firm evidence that they met then, or even last summer, when Mr. Abdulmutallab returned before heading off to Qaeda training camps, where he probably did meet Mr. Awlaki; the school denies that they ever met here.
        
        John Walker Lindh, the American who was captured fighting for the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001, studied here before fighting the Americans, and in general the university is seen as a center for jihadist ideas. While the school says lectures are only for students, the mosque is open to all Muslims.
        
        The university has more than 4,000 students and teaches courses in Islam and Western disciplines, sometimes trying to meld the two. Sheik Zindani, thought to be 59 and favoring a long dyed beard, is well known for his effort to prove that the Koran predicts Western scientific discoveries, and he has claimed to have cured AIDS. One of his books, translated shakily into English, with charts about the ruminant stomach of the cow, photosynthesis and other scientific discoveries, is called "Signs & Mericals [sic] of Prophet Messenger, Peace be Upon Him."
        
        Hood Abu Ras, who runs Sheik Zindani's university office, denies that Mr. Abdulmutallab was ever here, or that anything happens at Al Eman except scholarship.
        
        "Has the U.S. ever produced any evidence of Sheik Zindani's involvement in terror?" Mr. Abu Ras asked. As for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, an alliance of Saudi and Yemeni Qaeda operatives, he said, "It gets more propaganda than it deserves."
        
        The sheik himself, at a recent news conference, said he opposed foreign forces in Yemen.
        
        "We accept any cooperation in the framework of respect and joint interests, and we reject military occupation of our country," he said, adding: "Yemen's rulers and people must be careful before a guardianship is imposed on them" by foreigners.
        
        He was blunter in Friday Prayer at another mosque, when he warned of an American plot to occupy Yemen, based on a London conference scheduled for Jan. 28 whose stated subject is Afghanistan.
        
        "The U.K. request for an international conference on Yemen is meant to pave the way for a U.N. Security Council resolution to approve an occupation of Yemen and to put it under a U.N. mandate," Mr. Zindani said, as the worshipers shouted, "No to occupation!" He said that Washington's "so-called war on terror is in fact a war against Islam," according to Al Jazeera.
        
        After his sermon, he told a reporter for Al Jazeera: "Obama's advisers recommended that if Yemen becomes a failed state, they have to occupy the oil resources and Yemen's seacoast. What is this military buildup on our coasts for? Is it really justified by piracy? No one really believes that."
        
        Sheik Zindani is no fan of American involvement in the Muslim world and has defended jihad -- beginning with the thousands of Muslims, many of them from Yemen, who heeded the call, as he did, to fight the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. Their alliance with the Taliban then was considered a fine thing, and Mr. bin Laden himself fought the Soviets.
        
        But the reaction to Afghanistan, including the creation of Al Qaeda, has hit Yemen, too. Sheik Zindani, who has considerable political and moral weight, has come out against terrorism, if not jihad, and President Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen has failed to get Washington to remove the sheik from the terrorist list. Even a senior Western diplomat said that the sheik "has kept his head down for the last few years," since he took legal action against Yemeni newspapers and journalists in 2006 for reprinting even censored parts of the Danish cartoons of Muhammad.
        
        Mr. Saleh, who has run Yemen for 31 years, told The New York Times in June 2008 that ruling here is like "dancing with snakes."
        
        Sheik Zindani and his conservative brand of Islam -- Yemeni Salafism -- has strong support from Saudi Arabia and one of Mr. Saleh's oldest allies, Ali Mohsen. They are all pillars of the current government, even if Mr. Mohsen opposes the dynastic succession of Mr. Saleh's son, Ahmed, to the presidency.
        
        While Yemeni Salafism is not as militant as the Saudi variety -- Wahhabism -- Sheik Zindani studied in Saudi Arabia, and the mental landscape of the Salafis and Al Qaeda is very similar -- conservative, anti-Western, devoted to purifying Islam and returning to the practices they believe existed at the time of Prophet Muhammad.
        
        Mr. Mohsen, a general who is currently prosecuting the war against a Houthi rebellion in the north, also recruited thousands of Yemenis to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan. His brigades returned victorious, and Mr. Saleh has used them since to help defeat the south in the 1994 civil war and against the Houthis. Some fighters, of course, have migrated to Al Qaeda, and there are imams here more radical than Mr. Zindani.
        
        When north and south Yemen were united in 1990, Sheik Zindani accepted Mr. Saleh's rule and was granted this huge area of government land on the western edge of Sana for the university -- adjoining a large military base, which is Mr. Mohsen's headquarters. There are rumors that students sometimes get military training there, which Mr. Abu Ras also denies.
        
        Tuition, housing and food are free for students, and there is a primary school for their children. But with the Treasury Department crackdown on financing suspected terrorist groups, Yemeni analysts say that the school now has less money, that the number of students is down at least 2,000 and that there is less food in the cafeteria.
        
        Ismail al-Suhailyi, who has taught political science here for 13 years, said that the West must concentrate on economic development, not just security assistance.
        
        "Otherwise, the people will see their government working only for the interests of the Americans," he said.
        
        "Al Qaeda is part of Yemen, but they are just a few hundred people," Mr. Suhailyi said, advocating further dialogue with Al Qaeda.
        
        "I hope the American government will work to solve the problems here, and not become part of the problem."

    textlede: Yemen requests Canada's assistance in fight against terror, poverty
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        OTTAWA - Yemen's top diplomat is asking Canada to support his country's fight against terrorism and help with economic development programs, saying both are crucial to his country's future.
        
        Foreign Affairs Minister Abubaker Alqirbi was in Ottawa on Monday as part of a tour to rehabilitate his country's image following the failed attempt by Yemen's branch of al-Qaida to bomb a Detroit-bound passenger jet on Christmas Day.
        
        "There can be no development without security and no security without development," said Alqirbi, who met with Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon.
        
        Cannon made no commitments, suggesting Canada is considering a request for increased development spending in Yemen to stop militants from recruiting poor vulnerable people to its ranks.
        
        Yemen is a major focus of U.S. anti-terror efforts and the Yemeni government has vowed swift action to stamp out the militant group al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula.
        
        Yemeni officials claimed last week that government airstrikes killed six al-Qaida operatives, including the group's top military leader and three others who were on the government's list of the most-wanted al-Qaida figures in the country.
        
        But the terror group denied in an Internet statement Monday that any of its leaders were killed in the strikes.
        
        Alqirbi, however, said in Ottawa that he believes the dead men were simply buried before the military could verify the success of the operation.
        
        Alqirbi stressed that along with military action, development support is crucial in fighting terrorism in his country.
        
        "The issue of security has been the focus of the media but it is not new to Yemen. There has been jihadist presence in Yemen for the last 20 years, ever since the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan," he said.
        
        "Consequently as the economic situation in Yemen has deteriorated, the jihadists have taken advantage of it, and increased their extremist activities within the country."
        
        Alqirbi would not publicly discuss the specifics of the request he made while in Ottawa.
        
        But a draft version of his speech to diplomats and government officials, obtained by The Canadian Press, outlined several specific requests.
        
        They include assistance to "strengthen good governance and democratic institutions," pay for development and education programs, train coast guard personnel, and establish an unspecified "Canadian presence" to assist "existing and future business and trade."
        
        "We mentioned it in our meetings. We have to leave some things behind closed doors," Alqirbi said when asked why he cut those specifics out of his speech.
        
        He moved to play down any threat to the foreign oil and gas companies operating in Yemen, including Nexen Inc. and Calvalley Petroleum, both based in Alberta.
        
        He also touted business opportunities in mining, agriculture and tourism.

    textlede: 6 Al Qaeda militants killed in Yemen air strike
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        SANAA: Six al Qaeda militants were killed in an air strike in northern Yemen Friday in a stepped-up government campaign against the Islamist group. Yemen, which gained a reputation as a haven for al Qaeda after the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, came under the spotlight after crackdowns on the group in Pakistan and Afghanistan raised concern it was becoming a training and recruiting center for militants.
        
        "Two cars carrying eight dangerous al Qaeda members were hit in an area between Saada and al-Jouf," a Yemeni security official told Reuters.
        
        "Two may have survived and escaped."
        
        "The group included Qassem al-Remi, Ayed al-Shabwani, Ammar al-Waeli, and Saleh al-Teys," the official said. The four were wanted by the Yemeni and U.S. security services.
        
        "It is believed that Qassem al-Remi and Ayed al-Shabwani were killed in the air strike."
        
        Al-Shabwani was one of the most dangerous al Qaeda members who provided a hideout for other militants at his farm in Maarib, where their training took place, the official said. Maarib is a mountainous eastern province where the oil and gas fields of major international companies are located. Gregory Johnsen, a Yemen scholar at Princeton University, said al-Remi s death, if confirmed, would be "a very, very significant blow against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula," though it would not necessarily make the whole group crumble.
        
        "He is the most dangerous individual in the group based on his history, his statements and his role. He fought in Afghanistan and was central to rebuilding the organization and planning and conducting attacks."
        
        The security source in Yemen said Abu Ayman al-Masri, an Egyptian national known as Saleh al-Joufi in Yemen, was among the six killed today. He was the ideological brain of the group in Yemen. The government was also trying to negotiate the surrender of U.S.-Yemeni cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, said to have traded emails with the American army psychiatrist who killed 13 people at a U.S. army base in November, a government official said.

    textlede: Obama's War Over Terror
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Peter Baker is a White House correspondent for The Times and a contributing writer for the magazine.
        
        
        
        The evening before he was sworn into office, Barack Obama stepped out of Blair House, the government residence where he was staying across from the White House, and climbed into an armored limousine for the ride to a bipartisan dinner. Joining him in the back seat were John Brennan, his new counterterrorism adviser, and two foreign-policy advisers, Denis McDonough and Mark Lippert. The three men with the president-elect were out of breath, having rushed more than a mile from transition headquarters on foot after failing to find a taxi in Washington's preinaugural madness. As the motorcade moved out, they updated Obama on gathering evidence of a major terrorist plot to attack his inauguration. After a weekend of round-the-clock analysis, the nation's intelligence agencies were concerned that the threat was real, the men told him. A group of Somali extremists was reported to be coming across the border from Canada to detonate explosives as the new president took the oath of office. With more than a million onlookers viewing the ceremony from the National Mall and hundreds of millions more watching on television around the world, what could be a more devastating target?
        
        "All the data points suggested there was a real threat evolving quickly that had an overseas component," Juan Carlos Zarate, President George W. Bush's deputy national security adviser for combating terrorism, told me last fall. As the inauguration approached, signs of a plot "seemed to be growing in credibility and relevance."
        
        Another senior Bush official involved in those tense events a year ago said that protecting the new president was not enough. Even a failed attack would send a debilitating message to the world.
        
        "If something happens on the podium and there's chaos," this official told me, "that's the first time you see the new president, and you really don't want that."
        
        The threat seemed to weigh on Obama. He canceled a practice session to go over his inaugural address with aides at Blair House. David Axelrod, his senior adviser, later interpreted that as a sign that Obama was thinking about the suspected plot.
        
        "He seemed more subdued than he had been," Axelrod told me not long ago. Obama had not yet taken office, and he was already being confronted with the threat that consumed his predecessor's presidency. No matter how much he thought about terrorism as a senator or as a presidential candidate, it was another thing to face it as the person responsible for the nation's security -- and quite another thing again to know the threat was aimed directly at himself, his wife and their two daughters.
        
        "It's not as if you don't know what you're getting into," Axelrod said.
        
        "But when the reality comes and the baton is being passed and you're now dealing with real terrorism threats, it's a very sobering moment."
        
        There was little Obama could do but ask questions and rely on the people who had been fighting this fight for years. His advisers worked side by side with the outgoing administration. The two teams gathered in the Situation Room of the White House shortly before the inauguration to sift through what was known and to hash out what should be done about it. The final iteration of Bush's team sat across the table from the brain trust of Obama's administration -- Condoleezza Rice, Stephen Hadley and their colleagues on one side, Hillary Rodham Clinton, James Jones and their colleagues on the other.
        
        Clinton immediately put her finger on a problem. According to participants, she asked, What should Obama do if he is in the middle of his inaugural address and a bomb goes off somewhere on the mall? "Is the Secret Service going to whisk him off the podium so the American people see their incoming president disappear in the middle of the inaugural address?" she asked.
        
        "I don't think so."
        
        Among those in the room was Robert Gates, who served two years as Bush's defense secretary and would remain in that post under Obama. Gates would eventually stay away from the inauguration in a secret location. With no other member of Obama's cabinet confirmed by the Senate, Gates -- an incumbent cabinet officer who also had the imprimatur of the newly elected commander in chief -- was the most logical person in the line of succession to take over the presidency should the worst happen.
        
        At the heart of the deliberations about what to do was John Brennan, a former C.I.A. officer. A Middle East specialist known for setting up the National Counterterrorism Center for Bush, Brennan was coming back after three years out of government as the top counterterrorism official in the White House. He had wanted to be C.I.A. director but found his potential appointment sunk by liberal protests over his ties to the old order, so instead he was made assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, a position that did not require Senate confirmation.
        
        As he helped manage the inaugural threat, culling reports and coordinating between two administrations, Brennan was already becoming the most important voice in the ear of the new president as he moved to reshape the nation's struggle with terrorists. If it is now Obama's war, Brennan is his general. And the first battle set the tone.
        
        "It was a poignant reminder of the seriousness of the issue the president would be facing, on the eve of the inauguration," Brennan told me in November.
        
        Brennan suspected that the threat was a classic "poison pen," when one group of radicals rats out another group to get Americans to take out its rivals, and he was right. In this case, officials familiar with the situation said, some Somali extremists knew that a rival group was traveling to the United States and planted false information about its intentions that got back to the Americans. In the end, what for 72 hours looked like a credible threat turned out to be a false alarm.
        
        For a fledgling president, the incident would be a lesson in the fluid, murky nature of terrorism. The challenge of leading the struggle against violent extremists is more than just hunting down bad guys; it's distinguishing between what's real and what's not, tracking down where threats begin, figuring out the right response and finding a balance between acknowledging danger and projecting confidence. The Obama administration spent its first year in office trying to find its balance.
        
        BARACK OBAMA WAS inaugurated as the first president to take office in the Age of Terrorism. He inherited two struggles -- one with Al Qaeda and its ideological allies, and another that divides his own country over issues like torture, prosecutions, security and what it means to be an American. The first has proved to be complicated and daunting. The second makes the first look easy.
        
        The attempted bombing of a Northwest Airlines passenger jet on Christmas Day heightened a debate that has percolated over the past 12 months. Obama's approach has been either a dangerous reversal of the Bush years or a consolidation of the Bush years, depending on who is talking. In fact, the new president, during his first year, has adopted the bulk of the counterterrorism strategy he found on his desk when he arrived in the Oval Office, a strategy already moderated from the earliest days after Sept. 11, 2001. He did, however, shave back some of the harsher edges of the remaining Bush policies and in the process of his recalibrations drew simultaneous fire from former Vice President Dick Cheney and the American Civil Liberties Union.
        
        Obama, then, found himself in a place where he seems most comfortable, splitting the difference on a tough issue and presenting it as the course of reasoned judgment rather than of dogmatic ideology. Where Bush saw black and white, Obama sees gray. Where Bush favored swagger, Obama is searching for a more supple blend of force and intellect. Where Bush saw Islamic extremism as an existential threat equivalent to Nazism or Communism, Obama contends that that view warps the situation out of proportion and plays into terrorists' hands by elevating their stature and allowing them -- even without attacking again -- to alter the nature of American society.
        
        With joblessness still plaguing the economy and health care dominating his agenda, Obama has not wanted his presidency to be defined by the war on terror, as Bush's was. He has given relatively few public speeches on the topic and declined to discuss it for this article. Rather than seeing terrorism as the challenge of our time, Obama rejects the phrase "war on terror" altogether, hoping to recast the struggle as only one of a number of vital challenges confronting America. The nation is at war with Al Qaeda, Obama says, but not with terrorism, which, as he understands it, is a tactic, not an enemy.
        
        "There was a tendency on the part of some to view the world through that prism -- you know, are you with us or against us, black and white, this global war on terror," Brennan told me a couple of months ago in his windowless, low-ceilinged, soundproof office in the West Wing, where mobile phones are banned.
        
        "It was almost all-consuming. It was the driving force for our foreign policies, that we were now engaged in this march on the global war on terror."
        
        That attitude, Brennan went on to say, proved counterproductive.
        
        "This president recognizes that there's still a very serious terrorist threat that we face from organizations like Al Qaeda," he said.
        
        "But at the same time, what we have to do is make sure that we're not pouring fuel on the flames by the things that we do."
        
        And so perhaps the biggest change Obama has made is what one former adviser calls the "mood music" -- choice of language, outreach to Muslims, rhetorical fidelity to the rule of law and a shift in tone from the all-or-nothing days of the Bush administration. He is committed to taking aggressive actions to disrupt terrorist cells, aides said, but he also considers his speech in Cairo to the Islamic world in June central to his efforts to combat terrorism.
        
        "If you asked him what are the most important things he's done to fight terrorism in his first year, he would put Cairo in the top three," Rahm Emanuel, his chief of staff, told me.
        
        The policies themselves, though, have not changed nearly as much as the political battles over closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay and trying Khalid Shaikh Mohammed in New York would suggest.
        
        "The administration came in determined to undo a lot of the policies of the prior administration," Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the top Republican on the homeland-security committee, told me, "but in fact is finding that many of those policies were better-thought-out than they realized -- or that doing away with them is a far more complex task."
        
        If terrorism has not been the driving force of the Obama presidency, neither has it been the catalytic issue to the American people that it was more than eight years ago, when the twin towers collapsed in a heap of steel, concrete and bodies. Yet that mood can change in a hurry, as the Christmas Day plot showed. Obama understands that, if only by the law of averages, there is a decent chance of a successful major attack on the United States during his presidency. And if that attack happens, any change in policy, no matter how incidental to the facts of the case, will be fodder for critics to blame him for the attack. When the aviation screening and intelligence systems that Bush built failed to stop Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a 23-year-old Nigerian with ties to Al Qaeda's branch in Yemen, from getting on a plane bound for Detroit with explosives in his underwear last month, a number of Obama's political opponents blamed the sitting president. If Bush's system was broken, they asked, why didn't Obama fix it?
        
        But the underlying complaint seemed less about any particular policy than about Obama himself -- how he reacted, how he spoke, how he led. Although he held conference calls every day with Brennan, who was back in Washington, it took Obama three days to emerge from his Hawaiian vacation to address the matter in public, and when he did, he was typically cool and cerebral, with none of Bush's bring-it-on, dead-or-alive rhetoric. Never mind that Bush took six days to publicly address the 2001 case of Richard Reid, the shoe bomber, or that Reid was charged in civilian court, not as an enemy combatant; critics like Cheney argued again that Obama did not believe America was at war. Bush felt it in his gut. Obama thinks about it in his head. If he rushed out in public to talk the minute something happened, wouldn't that play into the hands of those trying to instill fear in the American people? Shouldn't he prudently wait for more information? Yet with the country afraid, is it possible to overthink it?
        
        "You've got almost two extremes," Henry Crumpton, who led the C.I.A.'s operation in Afghanistan after Sept. 11 and who later served as counterterrorism chief at the State Department under Bush, told me several weeks before the Christmas Day attempt.
        
        "You've got Bush 43, who aspired to have a warrior's ethos. He was driven, I think, by that, and in some ways it hurt us with the lack of rigor and examination of some of the consequences of our actions, Iraq being the most horrible extreme. Obama comes at it from the other extreme. He comes at it like a lawyer would, someone who may not accept and may even reject this idea of a warrior's ethos. And it is a war. You've got guys out there who want to kill us."
        
        OBAMA WAS A STATE senator in Illinois when the planes smashed into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and an empty field in Pennsylvania. He was driving to a legislative hearing in Chicago when he heard early reports on the radio.
        
        "By the time I arrived at my meeting," he wrote in his book "The Audacity of Hope," "the second plane had already hit, and we were told to evacuate the State of Illinois Building. Up and down the streets, people gathered, staring at the sky and at the Sears Tower. Later, in my law office, a group of us sat motionless as the nightmare images unfolded across the TV screen."
        
        That day instilled in Bush a sense of unwavering purpose, but Obama's support for the pursuit of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan gave way to doubts about the circumvention of legal structures at home and eventually outright opposition to the war in Iraq begun in the name of Sept. 11. As a Harvard Law School graduate who taught constitutional law and spent part of his childhood in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, Obama saw the emerging global struggle through a different lens.
        
        In the spring of 2007, when he was a presidential candidate, Obama met Richard Clarke, the former White House counterterrorism chief who had become one of Bush's sharpest critics on terrorism and national security. The two got together in a run-down apartment a few blocks from the Capitol that Obama used for inconspicuous meetings.
        
        "When I first sat down with him and started going through my standard pitch, he was finishing the sentences," Clarke told me.
        
        "I'd like to think it was because he read my book, but it's a heck of a lot more involved than my book. He'd talked with a lot of people. He'd read a lot about it. And he had a real understanding."
        
        Clarke became his campaign counterterrorism adviser, and Obama decided to give a speech outlining his view of how to combat extremists and how not to. His advisers told him he had a choice: he could try to out-Cheney Cheney and demonstrate that when it comes to national security, Democrats also have hairy chests, as one put it, or he could develop a new paradigm. Obama, typically, found the idea of a new paradigm more appealing, although he threw in a vow to strike terrorists in Pakistan even, if necessary, without permission of its government.
        
        "It is time to turn the page," he declared in the speech he gave in Washington in August 2007. He said that "America is at war with terrorists who killed on our soil; we are not at war with Islam."
        
        He criticized claims of "unchecked presidential power" and vowed "to close Guantanamo, reject the Military Commissions Act and adhere to the Geneva Conventions."
        
        He said "that means no more illegal wiretapping of American citizens, no more national-security letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime" and "no more ignoring the law when it is inconvenient."
        
        By the time he won the presidency more than a year later, he was receiving classified briefings on terrorist networks around the world. The government's top intelligence officials beat a path to Chicago to fill him in. They confronted him with the dark side, as Cheney once put it.
        
        "The risks we are talking about are the things you don't want to talk about around the Thanksgiving table," Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security, told me.
        
        Yet even some of the Bush appointees were ready for change, appealing to Obama to revamp the struggle.
        
        "Mr. President-elect, we're doing things very well, but we're losing the messaging war," Michael Leiter, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, told him a week after the election, according to an official informed about the session. A significant share of the global population thought America was at war against the rest of the world, Leiter maintained.
        
        "You have an opportunity to change that message, to change how the struggle is perceived," he said.
        
        Obama was receptive to that mandate.
        
        "We're going to do that," he replied.
        
        When Obama sat down to talk with the outgoing president, Bush pressed him to be vigilant every day.
        
        "That's mostly what they talked about," a senior Bush adviser told me.
        
        "I think President Bush came away thinking that President Obama understood at an intellectual level, but you don't really understand at a gut level until you're in that seat."
        
        Martha Joynt Kumar, a professor at Towson University who wrote about the inaugural threat in a paper published last month in the journal Presidential Studies Quarterly, said the teamwork between old and new administrations marked one of the smoothest presidential transitions in modern times. Yet for all the cooperation, Obama chose to make one of his first acts a strike against the Bush legacy, signing executive orders drafted by his new White House counsel, Greg Craig, that banned interrogation techniques like waterboarding as torture and ordered the prison at Guantanamo closed within a year. The move generated debate about timing and tactics. John Podesta, who ran Obama's transition, agreed with the policy but argued against making Guantanamo the first priority right after inauguration, according to colleagues. Craig and others countered that it was important to send a signal of change from the start.
        
        Obama also wanted to uproot the resentments and hatred that fuel extremism.
        
        "The language we use matters," he told the Al Arabiya television network a week after taking office. So Obama informally banished the rhetoric of the last administration.
        
        "War on terror" was out; so were "Islamofascism" and "evildoers."
        
        The new language did not always go over well. While testifying to Congress a year ago, Napolitano used the phrase "man-caused disasters," and though she said "terrorism" elsewhere in her remarks, she drew wide scorn. ("I was totally misinterpreted in a sense of what I was trying to communicate," she later told me.
        
        "It was just a mistake. In the editing process, that phrase, usually it's 'terrorism or other man-caused disasters.' ")
        
        BRENNAN, WHO HAS emerged in recent days as the administration's public face for counterterrorism policy, is solidly built, with a weathered face and close-cropped, retreating hair. His eyes seem to take your measure when you walk into the room, studying intently as if searching for your ulterior motives. He is friendly and unfailingly polite but does not laugh easily. He is a serious man in a serious business, a career man, a survivor, someone who has navigated the treacherous politics of the intelligence world and vaulted to great heights only to be disappointed. And now he is helping Obama redirect the war against Al Qaeda.
        
        A native of North Bergen, N.J., Brennan, who is 54, attended Catholic schools, all the way through Fordham University. After his freshman year, he went to Indonesia in the summer of 1974 to visit a cousin who was working there, and in the same country that helped shape Obama's worldview, Brennan developed a case of youthful wanderlust. He studied Arabic and played basketball with Egyptians at the American University in Cairo before earning a master's degree in Middle East studies at the University of Texas at Austin. While reading The New York Times on a bus one day, he saw a C.I.A. recruitment ad and decided to apply. When I asked why, he gave an answer that sounded as if it came from an espionage novel.
        
        "Nathan Hale was hanged on the day of my birth," he said of the nation's first spy.
        
        At the C.I.A., Brennan rose through the ranks, becoming station chief in Saudi Arabia during the late 1990s, a time of rising Islamic terrorism. Just months before he arrived in Riyadh, terrorists blew up the Khobar Towers apartment complex, killing 19 American service members. During his tour, they also attacked American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya. A favorite of George J. Tenet, the C.I.A. director first appointed by President Bill Clinton and later retained by Bush, Brennan would become Tenet's chief of staff and later the agency's deputy executive director.
        
        After Sept. 11, Brennan helped set up the Terrorist Threat Integration Center and served as its first and only director. But his steady rise reached a peak. When the center was refashioned as the National Counterterrorism Center, bringing together experts across the government to coordinate the war on terror, he served as interim director but was never given the permanent job. Brennan, unhappy, left government in 2005 and went on to write a proposed op-ed essay that he titled, "Mr. President, You're Wrong on Iraq."
        
        In keeping with C.I.A. rules, he submitted it for classification review by the agency before distributing it to any newspapers for publication. A copy found its way to the White House, where it angered top officials. Brennan ultimately thought better of the article and withdrew it from C.I.A. review, but it was too late to salvage his standing at the White House.
        
        "He was dead to them," says a friend and fellow senior official, who did not want to be named discussing internal matters. An attempt to later make him deputy director of national intelligence was killed by the White House. Obama presented another chance.
        
        "This is redemption," the friend says.
        
        Anthony Lake, a former national security adviser who knew Brennan from his days as a C.I.A. briefer in the Clinton White House, was working for Obama's nascent presidential campaign and brought in the former intelligence officer to advise the candidate in 2007. Obama grew to like Brennan's precise, matter-of-fact style so much that after the election he considered making him the C.I.A. director. But the idea of appointing Tenet's right-hand man, a C.I.A. careerist who was at the center of the Bush war on terror, rankled Obama supporters on the left.
        
        Stephen Soldz, a psychologist at the Boston Graduate School of Psychoanalysis and a leader of the Coalition for an Ethical Psychology, circulated a letter of opposition to Brennan signed by 200 other psychologists. The letter cited an interview Brennan gave in 2006 to PBS's "Frontline," in which he said Tenet's concern in devising the Bush-era interrogation program was making sure it was on sound legal footing.
        
        "We know, of course, that 'the appropriate Department of Justice review' means that torture was authorized and conducted by our government," Soldz's letter said.
        
        But the letter did not quote the rest of what Brennan said in that interview as he grappled with the morality of the government's actions.
        
        "There was a real debate within the agency, including today, about what are the minimum standards that you want to stoop to and beyond where you're not going to go, because we don't want to stoop to using the same types of standards that terrorists use," he told PBS.
        
        "We are in this business, whether it be intelligence or the government, to protect freedom, democracy and liberty, not to violate that."
        
        Still, human rights advocates have a point about continuity. For all his talk of change, Obama has kept a lot of veterans of the Bush administration in place. Besides Brennan, there is Gates still atop the Pentagon, as well as Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff appointed by Bush, and Michael Vickers, still the assistant defense secretary for special operations. While Obama tapped Leon Panetta to take over the C.I.A., he kept the deputy director, Stephen Kappes, along with Leiter, the head of the National Counterterrorism Center. Obama fired the top general in Afghanistan, but the head of the regional military command overseeing both Afghanistan and Iraq remains Bush's favorite officer, Gen. David Petraeus, and the White House coordinator for Afghanistan and Pakistan is Bush's Iraq war czar, Lt. Gen. Douglas Lute. To manage the effort to close Guantanamo, Obama named one of Bush's assistant secretaries of state, Daniel Fried. The Treasury under secretary chasing terrorist financing is still Stuart Levey, and the National Security Council's senior director for combating terrorism is still Nick Rasmussen.
        
        Most of those people, of course, were in the moderate camp inside the Bush administration, not the Cheney cadre, or like Brennan they present themselves as simply career professionals who followed orders or who even quietly dissented from the most extreme policies of the last eight years.
        
        "I was somebody who did oppose waterboarding," Brennan told me.
        
        "I opposed different aspects of the enhanced interrogation program. But there were some aspects of it that I concurred with."
        
        For instance, he offered, "if you grab somebody by the lapels, and you say, Oh, my goodness, you've violated their rights as a person, well, I'm not going to go that far."
        
        Time and circumstances have changed as well.
        
        "Four years ago, I would have said -- and I did say -- the agency's detention program needed to continue," Brennan said, referring to the secret "black site" overseas prisons run by the C.I.A.
        
        "There have been a lot of developments and changes, so the things I might have advocated three or four years ago, because of the changed conditions, because of a new administration, whatever, I wouldn't necessarily advocate them now at all. I've changed my views."
        
        Soldz told me he has been pleased that Brennan has said the right things since taking the White House job. But Obama's refusal to completely repudiate the Bush-era policies bothers Soldz.
        
        "I wake up some mornings disgusted by Obama," he said.
        
        "And then I think about it some more and understand the pressure he's under. So I'm having these battles inside myself."
        
        SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER Obama took office, I sat down with the president, along with three colleagues from The Times, in his conference room on Air Force One during a flight back from an event in Ohio. Now that he was in office, we asked what, if anything, he had come to believe that Bush had gotten right in the balance between security and civil liberties.
        
        The candidate who denounced the "color-coded politics of fear" and rejected policies that "compromised our most precious values" was now a commander in chief wrestling with how to protect those values and the country at the same time. He told us that many of the worst practices he had objected to had already been corrected by the end of Bush's presidency.
        
        "I would distinguish between some of the steps that were taken immediately after 9/11 and where we were by the time I took office," he told us.
        
        "I think the C.I.A., for example, and some of the controversial programs that have been a focus of a lot of attention, took steps to correct certain policies and procedures after those first couple of years."
        
        The battle with terrorists evolved significantly over the course of the Bush presidency, and when Obama took office, the course he set was mostly to accelerate the evolution that was already under way. Under pressure from Supreme Court rulings, Congressional legislation and disclosures in the news media, Bush in his second term trimmed back some of his most expansive programs and claims to executive power. Two years before leaving office, he told advisers he wanted to use his remaining time to institutionalize what was left so that his successor, even a Democrat, would not feel compelled to reverse direction.
        
        By the time Obama was inaugurated, waterboarding had been halted for years, Bush had ordered that the secret C.I.A. black site prisons be emptied, and the warrantless surveillance program and the military commission system had been restructured and approved by Congress. Bush had even declared that he wanted to close the Guantanamo prison, and although he never managed to do so, his team released or transferred about 500 detainees as a first step.
        
        Obama built on those actions.
        
        "We've benefited from their experiences, both the good and the bad," Emanuel told me. While setting a one-year deadline to close Guantanamo and formally banning the interrogation methods that had already fallen out of favor, Obama left the surveillance program intact, embraced the Patriot Act, retained the authority to use renditions and embraced some of Bush's claims to state secrets. He preserved the military commissions and national security letters he criticized during the campaign, albeit with more due-process safeguards. He plans to hold dozens of suspected terrorists without charges indefinitely. And he expanded Bush's campaign of unmanned drone strikes against Al Qaeda in the tribal areas of Pakistan. Troop levels in Afghanistan are set to triple on his watch.
        
        A half-dozen former senior Bush officials involved in counterterrorism told me before the Christmas Day incident that for the most part,they were comfortable with Obama's policies, although they were reluctant to say so on the record. Some worried they would draw the ire of Cheney's circle if they did, while others calculated that calling attention to the similarities to Bush would only make it harder for Obama to stay the course. And they generally resented Obama's anti-Bush rhetoric and were unwilling to give him political cover by defending him.
        
        Michael Hayden, the last C.I.A. director under Bush, was willing to say publicly what others would not.
        
        "There is a continuum from the Bush administration, particularly as it changed in the second administration as circumstances changed, and the Obama administration," Hayden told me. James Jay Carafano, a homeland-security expert at the Heritage Foundation, was blunter.
        
        "I don't think it's even fair to call it Bush Lite," he said.
        
        "It's Bush. It's really, really hard to find a difference that's meaningful and not atmospheric. You see a lot of straining on things trying to make things look repackaged, but they're really not that different."
        
        Not every Bush veteran agrees, of course. Marc Thiessen, a former White House speechwriter, has a new book called "Courting Disaster: How the C.I.A. Kept America Safe and How Barack Obama Is Inviting the Next Attack."
        
        Tom Ridge, the former homeland security secretary, told me before the Christmas Day plot that under Obama, Washington had "lost a certain sense of urgency and commitment to combating terrorism."
        
        Most disturbing to the Bush camp, even to those who generally see continuity in Obama's policies, have been Attorney General Eric Holder's decisions to release legal memos that described interrogation techniques used by the C.I.A., to reinvestigate allegations of interrogation abuse by C.I.A. officers and to take Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the self-declared mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, to New York to face trial in civilian court. Hayden recalled warning Jim Jones, Obama's national security adviser, last spring not to alienate the C.I.A. by dredging up the past.
        
        "You're about to spend the next 46 months without a clandestine service," Hayden recalled saying.
        
        "If these guys don't think you have their back, they're not going to be very adventurous."
        
        There is ample historical precedent for this cycle. During times of national crisis, Washington often claims more authority, sometimes to the point of excess, then slowly cedes it back, from the Sedition Act signed by John Adams to Abraham Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus during the Civil War to Franklin D. Roosevelt's internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II -- all cases in which the system eventually corrected itself in one fashion or another.
        
        "Historically the more we move away from a crisis, the better we're able to see the costs and benefits of what we're doing, and we go from being extremely risk-averse to finding a better balance," says Geoffrey Stone, a professor and former dean at the University of Chicago law school.
        
        Bush has pointed to another historical pattern. In private discussions with associates during the 2008 presidential campaign, he predicted that if a Democrat won, he or she would be like Dwight Eisenhower to his Harry Truman. Just as Eisenhower on the campaign trail criticized Truman's policies in the early years of the cold war only to essentially adopt them after taking office, Bush anticipated that his successor would preserve most of what he had put in place. Of course, this conveniently fits into Bush's hope that, like Truman, he will look better in the eyes of history. A senior Obama adviser scoffed at the idea that Bush advisers see continuity, arguing that they are trying to launder their reputations by claiming validation. But it is true that much of the Bush security architecture is almost certain to remain part of the national fabric for some time to come, thanks to Obama.
        
        Stone, who helped bring Obama to the University of Chicago law school, says his former colleague must be wary of doing anything that would increase the risk of a terrorist attack against the United States.
        
        "He may feel in fact," Stone says, "that it's a more dangerous world than he thought it was, that some of these measures may be more necessary than he thought."
        
        STONE JOINED A GROUP of human-rights and civil-liberties advocates at the White House last spring for a meeting with Obama to talk about issues of interrogation and detention. Obama had struggled through a rocky few months trying to find the balance between security and liberty, arguing that America did not need to sacrifice one for the other.
        
        The decision to close the Guantanamo prison sparked a revolt in Congress, even among Democrats who worried about suspected terrorists being transferred to prisons in their states. And while the administration has selected an Illinois facility to house some of the detainees, the Jan. 22 deadline to close Guantanamo will not be met. An attempt to release into the United States 17 Chinese Uighurs who were deemed no threat to Americans collapsed. And although Obama authorized the release of memos detailing the use of waterboarding and other techniques now banned, he refused to release photographs showing abuse of detainees.
        
        For Brennan, these issues were a chance to get right what he thought went wrong under Bush. But he has found himself at odds with other advisers at times. When Craig and Holder wanted to release the memos about C.I.A. interrogation methods, Brennan initially agreed, reasoning that the tactics in the memos had by then been banned. But he later reversed himself and sided with the C.I.A., which argued that the memos would give terrorists too much information about how American interrogators work. Brennan likewise stood with Gates and military leaders who argued unsuccessfully that releasing photographs of the abuses would inflame radicals and endanger American troops. Gen. Ray Odierno, the top commander in Iraq, made a personal appeal to Obama during a visit to Washington, and the president agreed to reject Craig's recommendation to release the photos. Brennan also found an ally at times in Rahm Emanuel, who was said to think that the politics of these decisions were being mishandled and that fights over detention policy used up political capital better spent on priorities like health care and the economy.
        
        By the time he sat down with the human rights advocates in the Cabinet Room, Obama was preparing to make a speech at the National Archives about such issues. Everyone in the room raised hard questions, voicing the disappointment of Obama's strongest supporters. Perhaps the most dramatic appeal came from Anthony Romero, executive director of the A.C.L.U.
        
        "Look, you're the only politician I've ever believed in," Romero said, according to people in the room.
        
        "When I was a gay Puerto Rican growing up in New York, I never thought I could identify with a political leader the way I identify with you. But this stuff really pains me."
        
        Obama pushed back, explaining the constraints he was under. It was a balancing act, he said; he had multiple obligations. Much of the discussion concerned the military commissions he decided to keep and the dilemma of what to do with the hardest cases at Guantanamo, those who could not be prosecuted because of tainted evidence or other reasons but were deemed too dangerous to release.
        
        "He wasn't entirely comfortable with any of the options," says Tom Malinowski, the Washington advocacy director of Human Rights Watch.
        
        When I talked with Romero later, he would not describe his interaction with Obama, but he expressed his frustration. While relieved that the new president seems more open to rethinking Bush-era policies, Romero said he suspected Obama suffers from the "hubris" of wanting to preserve much of the power he inherited in the belief that he will use it more wisely.
        
        "He believes he can do it better and smarter and more in keeping with constitutional principles than his predecessor did," Romero told me.
        
        "If he's shown himself willing to adhere to some of the Bush policies in the absence of an attack, one worries about what he'll do when an attack comes."
        
        The activists left the meeting chilled that Obama seemed poised to continue holding some terrorism suspects indefinitely without charges. Just a few years earlier, he wrote in his book that "when we detain suspects indefinitely without trial," then "we weaken our ability to pressure for human rights and the rule of law in despotic regimes."
        
        Now he was talking about seeking legislation that would permanently authorize such preventive detention. Romero and the A.C.L.U. began preparing a campaign against any proposed legislation if he went forward, soliciting letters from international figures like Desmond Tutu, trying to recruit Jimmy Carter and contacting law-school academics. But then the administration reversed course; while it would continue to hold indefinitely without charges perhaps 50 detainees left from the Bush era, it would not enshrine the power in law and signaled that it would not use it for future cases.
        
        "We were gearing up for the battle of our lives," Romero said.
        
        "Fortunately, they turned back from the abyss."
        
        Liberals were also cheered by a speech Brennan gave in Washington over the summer at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Brennan said Obama "is bringing a fundamentally new and more effective approach," one that would be more "multidimensional" without letting terrorism define American foreign policy. Among other things, he emphasized the "upstream factors," meaning the conditions that fuel extremism, and vowed to promote "a political, economic and social campaign to meet the basic needs and legitimate grievances of ordinary people -- security for their communities, education for children, a job and income for parents and a sense of dignity and worth."
        
        But something else was happening inside the White House. Some in the West Wing, like Emanuel, worried about the collateral cost of Holder's decision that would take Khalid Shaikh Mohammed to New York. Those concerns were relayed to the Justice Department, but Obama declined to intervene and let Holder make the call. Still, by the end of the year, the activists' favorite ally in the West Wing, Greg Craig, was out. He resigned after months of battles over the best way to reorient the war on terror, some that he won and others that he lost.
        
        "He was the one voice for a constant application of the rule of law in the White House," Romero lamented.
        
        "The others either demur or mumble."
        
        Craig's ouster, he added, was "unfortunate because it means the likes of Rahm Emanuel will consolidate power in the White House."
        
        AT THE HOUSE that John Brennan built, about 600 government employees keep tabs on what the extremists are up to, at least as much as they can. The National Counterterrorism Center, which Brennan set up on a leafy campus overlooking the Capital Beltway in the Virginia suburbs outside Washington, is the center of the nation's efforts to hunt down Al Qaeda and its cousins. Obama came to visit last fall, and Brennan accompanied him.
        
        The operations center at the NCTC looks a lot like the set from "24," the Fox television show, with dozens of analysts from an alphabet soup of agencies known by their acronyms -- C.I.A., F.B.I., D.O.D., N.S.A., D.I.A., D.H.S., D.N.I., T.S.A. and so on -- sitting together as they sift through surveillance videos, intercepted telephone calls, satellite imagery, reports from the field, news accounts and myriad other "intelligence streams," as they are known. A dozen large flat-screen televisions tune in everything from satellite reconnaissance to CNN. Digital clocks indicate the time in hot spots around the world. Multiscreen computers help collate vast quantities of information.
        
        This place was supposed to help stop the attack by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab aboard a plane over Detroit on Christmas Day. Since Sept. 11, government agencies like the NCTC have connected the dots repeatedly to head off terrorist attacks. In the last few months alone, the government has arrested a number of suspected plotters in the United States. But the cliche is right -- the government has to be right 100 percent of the time, while the other side needs to succeed only once. And Brennan produced a report this month that criticized the NCTC, his old organization, for failing to pull together intelligence that was available about Al Qaeda and Abdulmutallab before he boarded Northwest Flight 253 in Amsterdam last month.
        
        The Christmas Day plot touched off a new round of questions among Obama's criticsabout whether the president is enough of a warrior for the fight against Islamic terrorism. Buthe has spent much of his time in office killing suspected extremists. With information processed at the NCTC and elsewhere, Obama has authorized the C.I.A. to greatly expand a program inherited from Bush using unmanned Predator and Reaper drones to launch missiles at suspected Al Qaeda hideouts along the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Critics complain that such "targeted assassinations" are morally suspect and strategically dangerous because of the reaction among Pakistanis when civilians are killed. Obama had a searching conversation during the transition with Brennan and Denis McDonough, Catholics who oppose the death penalty, about whether to keep the program.
        
        "He was wrestling with it," one adviser says. But in the end, there was no serious disagreement with the decision to continue the program. At one of his first Situation Room meetings as president, according to a participant, Obama said pointedly, "The C.I.A. gets what it needs."
        
        The C.I.A. launched more than 50 such strikes in Obama's first year in office, more than during Bush's entire presidency, according to data compiled by Peter Bergen and Katherine Tiedemann at the New America Foundation. In part, that strategy owes to increasingly precise technology that has made it easier in the last couple of years to hit a desired target with fewer civilian casualties. And in part, it underscores the ability to redirect resources away from Iraq now that the war has subsided there; when the Obama administration came into office, it learned that dozens of drones were devoted to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan but just five or six in the tribal areas of Pakistan where Al Qaeda's leadership is mainly holed up, according to officials who declined to be identified discussing a classified program. Obama has authorized doubling the number of drones in the Pakistani border area, as well as increasing the presence over Yemen and Somalia, officials said.
        
        Over the course of Obama's first year in office, his drones have taken out a number of "high-value targets," including Baitullah Mehsud, leader of the Pakistani Taliban; Saad bin Laden, a son of Osama bin Laden; and Tahir Yuldashev, leader of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, a close ally of Al Qaeda. At the same time, according to estimates by Bergen and Tiedemann, the civilian death rate of those killed by drone strikes has fallen to about 24 percent in 2009 from about 40 percent from 2006 to 2008. Government officials insist that the civilian casualty rate is even lower.
        
        "I don't hear anyone inside the government, including people like me who came from outside, who thinks the Predator program is anything but essential," a senior Obama counterterrorism official says.
        
        "There are a lot of negatives, but it is completely essential."
        
        Obama has been willing to be muscular in other ways as well. When intelligence agencies concluded in September that they had found Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, an Al Qaeda operative linked to the 2002 bombing of a Kenyan hotel, in southern Somalia, officials debated three options, including one to insert American special-operations forces in that lawless East African country, several officials told me. Obama's advisers rejected that and presented him with a plan for an airstrike, which he approved. Weather on the day of the strike prompted a change in plans, and commanders instead authorized attack helicopters to sweep into Somalia. Nabhan was killed. American forces landed afterward to collect bodies and evidence.
        
        Most salient at the moment is Obama's focus on Yemen, the poor, unstable state south of Saudi Arabia where Osama bin Laden's family hailed from. Yemen in many ways is where Obama's two wars come together. It is a breeding ground for extremism, the home of the radical cleric who inspired Maj. Nidal Hasan before he opened fire at Fort Hood last fall and the origin of the Christmas Day bombing plot involving Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab. At the same time, it is the place where roughly half of the remaining detainees at Guantanamo come from, making it the central focus for efforts to close the prison.
        
        Brennan visited Yemen in March and again in September to focus new energy on combating Al Qaeda there. Obama has ordered more training, equipment and intelligence sharing for the Yemeni government; about $70 million was set aside to bulk up Yemeni forces, doubling previous spending, and the administration has announced it will double it again next year. Last month the American government provided intelligence and hardware for Yemeni airstrikes on suspected Al Qaeda hideouts. Brennan has also been trying to set up a rehabilitation program for Yemen to transition former Guantanamo detainees back into society. But for all the attention on Yemen, Brennan has now acknowledged that he and the rest of the American government underestimated the capacity of Al Qaeda's branch there to attack American soil.
        
        OBAMA WAS SINGING Christmas carols with his family at a rental house in Hawaii when a military aide arrived to tell him that someone tried to blow up a plane over Detroit. The president got on the phone with Brennan, who told him a Nigerian man tried to ignite chemicals hidden in his underwear, only to have passengers and crew jump him. Soon enough, Abdulmutallab would be tied to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which operates in Yemen.
        
        The Obama team's initial public response was less than sure-footed. Obama referred to Abdulmutallab as an "isolated extremist," and Janet Napolitano said that "the system worked."
        
        Obama would soon learn how wrong both assessments were. While on vacation he was given an 80-page review of the Fort Hood shooting; it looked at how information about Hasan was not well circulated within the federal government. The night after his first statement, the president's advisers learned that something similar happened in the Detroit case: the government possessed National Security Agency-intercepted conversations that could have helped to stop Abdulmutallab if they had been shared widely.
        
        Obama talked with Brennan and other advisers by phone the next morning. He was simmering.
        
        "Let me make this very clear to you," he told the advisers, according to two of them.
        
        "While I understand intelligence is hard, and I'll never fault anybody for not having full intelligence, what I will fault is when we have full intelligence that's not shared."
        
        After hanging up with Brennan, aides scrambled to organize a statement to the news media. Denis McDonough, the National Security Council chief of staff, typed out a draft on the president's laptop as Obama hovered over his shoulder.
        
        "What's the deal?" Obama asked.
        
        "I'm just about done," McDonough said.
        
        "Well, just move over."
        
        Obama sat down and finished it himself.
        
        The president's statement that there was a "systemic failure" did not quell the political furor. White House officials were caught off guard by the intensity of the criticism. After reading a Cheney statement that attacked Obama for only pretending to be at war with terrorists, David Axelrod angrily wrote a long statement trashing the former vice president and gave it to Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director, who revised it and posted on the White House Web site. The criticism got Brennan's back up too, particularly coming from some of his former colleagues in the Bush administration.
        
        "A lot of the knuckleheads I've been listening to out there on the network shows don't know what they're talking about," he told me after the Christmas Day attempt. Some Republicans, including Cheney, were blatantly mischaracterizing the record, he fumed.
        
        "When they say the administration's not at war with Al Qaeda, that is just complete hogwash."
        
        It was the angriest I had heard him during months of conversations.
        
        "What they're doing is just playing into Al Qaeda's strategic effort, which is to get us to battle among ourselves instead of focusing on them," he said.
        
        It is moments like these when Brennan's disaffection from the last administration becomes evident.
        
        "I much prefer talking with someone who is interested in understanding the situation and responding to it appropriately," Brennan told me.
        
        For all of the attention on the Nigerian underwear bomber, some experts say they believe the more insidious threat will be a new generation of homegrown extremists. In recent months, authorities have arrested a number of American citizens and legal residents, including Najibullah Zazi, an airport-shuttle driver who is suspected of plotting to attack New York after receiving training in Pakistan, and David Coleman Headley, a Pakistani-American accused of aiding terrorist attacks in Mumbai. Just a week ago, authorities arrested two associates of Zazi's. And then there is the Fort Hood shooting rampage, as well as a group of Somali-Americans from Minnesota who reportedly wanted to fight in Somalia and five American Muslims from Virginia who traveled to Pakistan supposedly to join the jihad.
        
        If they are the next wave, American extremists are going to be hard to track and stop. The Internet makes it possible for Al Qaeda and its allies to reach out from the dusty villages of Waziristan all the way to Illinois and Colorado.
        
        "Although no one wants to admit it, I think a watershed has been crossed in the terrorist threat in the United States," Bruce Hoffman, a Georgetown University terrorism scholar, told me.
        
        "It's way different than it was in the Bush years."
        
        The Obama administration has been trying to figure out how to counter it. In October, Obama secretly ordered a review of the ways different agencies track travels between the United States and places like Pakistan to look for holes to close. Napolitano told me: "We can't operate in the paradigm that if they attack us, they would be coming from other countries into the United States. We have some that are homegrown. That is a change."
        
        After all the lawyerly focus on Guantanamo and the rules of war, the latest threats put more focus on Obama in the role of commander in chief. It did not go unnoticed that when he accepted the Nobel Peace Prize, he declared that "evil does exist in the world."
        
        After the Christmas Day plot, his press secretary, Robert Gibbs, consciously or not, used the term "war on terror."
        
        The White House then dispatched Brennan for a blitz of four Sunday shows, the first such foray for the C.I.A. veteran.
        
        Obama made almost as many statements about terrorism in the two weeks following Christmas as he did in the 11 months preceding it, not counting those focused on Afghanistan.
        
        "Our nation is at war," Obama declared on Jan. 2.
        
        "We are at war," he said five days later as he released reports on the Detroit plot.
        
        The war goes on, abroad and at home.

    textlede: Forced to fight for al-Qaeda; Yemeni Islamist militants are 'recruiting' fleeing Somali youths, writes Sudarsan Raghavan
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        THOUSANDS of Somali boys and teenagers fleeing war and chaos at home are sailing to Yemen, where officials who have long welcomed Somali refugees now worry that the new arrivals could become the next generation of al-Qaeda fighters.
        
        As the US deepens its counter-terrorism operations in Yemen, officials are concerned that extremists could find growing Somali refugee camps fertile ground for recruiting. US and Yemeni authorities also fear that Islamist fighters from Somalia could slip into the country among the throngs of refugees, deepening ties between al-Qaeda leaders in Yemen and the particularly hard-line militants of Somalia.
        
        Fleeing a failed state for a failing one, the Somali youth arrive daily in this refugee outpost, filled with rickety tents and tales of misery, in the vast desert of southern Yemen. They bring stories of brutality and forced conscription by al-Shabab, an Islamist force battling Somalia's US-backed transitional government.
        
        "They ordered us to fight the non-believers," said Abdul Khadr Salot, 19, a burly ex-fighter with a thin scar across his cheek who escaped from a militant training camp.
        
        "Even if your father tells you to leave the Shabab, you must kill him."
        
        But this long-time haven is becoming increasingly inhospitable since the US bolstered its operations here, largely in response to the Yemeni al-Qaeda connections of the Nigerian man who allegedly tried to bomb a US airliner over Detroit on Christmas Day, and to the links of an extremist Yemeni American cleric to the November 5 shootings at Fort Hood, Texas.
        
        Yemen's fragile government fears that Somali fighters from al-Shabab will swell the ranks of Yemen's Islamist militants at a time when links between the Somali group and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula are growing, according to Yemeni officials and analysts.
        
        As it quietly wages war against extremists in the Arabian Peninsula and parts of Africa, the Obama administration could find itself confronting a unified, regional al-Qaeda on two continents. This would further stretch US resources as Washington fights major conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. It could also push Yemen - beset by mounting internal strife, poor governance, extreme poverty and dwindling resources - even deeper into a downward spiral.
        
        "Somalia for Yemen is becoming like what Pakistan is for Afghanistan," said Saeed Obaid, a Yemeni terrorism expert who wrote a book on al-Qaeda's Yemen affiliate.
        
        Leaders of al-Shabab, which the US has labelled a terrorist organisation with links to al-Qaeda's central body, declared last week that they would send fighters to help al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.
        
        That prompted Yemeni Foreign Minister Abu Bakr al-Qirbi to issue a stern warning through the state-run Saba news agency that Yemen would not allow "any terrorist elements from any country to operate in its territory".
        
        In recent days, Yemeni security forces have staged raids on Somali refugee communities, detaining suspected loyalists of al-Shabab, which means "The Youth". Overnight, an atmosphere of fear has gripped the community, which numbers more than a million.
        
        "The climate has changed, and it is heating up," Mohammed Ali, a top leader of the Somali community in the Yemeni capital of Sana'a, lamented over a glass of Somali coffee.
        
        An estimated 74 000 African refugees, mostly from Somalia and Ethiopia, arrived in Yemen last year, 50 percent more than in 2008, according to statistics from the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
        
        UNHCR officials say 309 either drowned in capsized boats or were killed by smugglers.
        
        In September, a gang of al-Shabab fighters grabbed 14-year-old Saber Ahmed at his father's shop in Mogadishu, the Somali capital.
        
        They blindfolded him and took him to a nearby militia base, he said. There, they brought out recruits he knew from his neighbourhood, who urged him to join. The peer pressure didn't work.
        
        Then, an al-Shabab commander gave him an ultimatum.
        
        "He said, 'We will kill you if you don't join us,'" recalled Ahmed, tall and lanky with a soft voice and chiselled face.
        
        After 20 days of training, he was sent to the front lines. Within hours, he said, a battle erupted; Ahmed was shot in the leg. He managed to crawl to his house. His father took him to a hospital. When Ahmed regained consciousness, his father gave him $100 and ordered him to flee to Yemen.
        
        In the Somali port of Bossaso, he handed the money to a smuggler, who placed him on a crowded boat headed for a treacherous sea. As the boat neared Yemen, it flipped over. Ahmed swam a kilometre to the shore. He later learnt that seven passengers had drowned.
        
        Ahmed's experience is a familiar one, according to Somali community leaders and officials at the UNHCR, which runs the camp here in Kharaz.
        
        Parents often say they bring their children to Yemen to prevent them from one day joining al-Shabab.
        
        "It's very easy to brainwash youth. They tell them, 'We'll give you money. We'll give you power,'" said Rocco Nuri, a UNHCR official in Aden.
        
        When told that former al-Shabab fighters were in Kharaz, Nuri expressed concern but said it was "impossible to monitor this" in an open camp where residents came and went freely. Nevertheless, he expressed confidence that the camp was not a haven or recruiting hub for Somali militants.
        
        In Yemen, Somalis are worse off than Yemenis. Jobs are scarce. Thousands of Somali youths eke out a living washing cars. They sleep under trees, and bathe in public water tanks. Most Somali refugees view Yemen as a transit point to richer nations such as Saudi Arabia. But, in recent months, a war between the Yemeni government and Shia Hawthi rebels in the north has stemmed the migration.
        
        Salafist schools, which teach a puritanical brand of Islam, have attracted several hundred young Somali refugees with offers of free food and lodging, say Somali community leaders. They fear some could join al-Shabab.
        
        "Some boys did return back to Somalia," said Deka Muhamed, a Somali elder in Sanaa.
        
        "We've heard they've been killed, but we don't know how or why."
        
        Yemeni officials, meanwhile, worry that al-Qaeda militants could lure Somali ex-fighters into their ranks. But so far, there has been no evidence of this, say Western diplomats and Yemeni officials.
        
        In an audio tape last year, Osama bin Laden exhorted al-Shabab to overthrow the Somali government. Radical Yemeni American cleric Anwar al-Aulaqi, whom the US has linked to the man suspected of the attempted Christmas Day bombing and to the gunman accused of the massacre at Fort Hood, has also expressed support for al-Shabab.
        
        Yemeni officials and analysts say there is regular communication between al-Qaeda militants in Yemen and al-Shabab.
        
        Last week, Somalia's state minister for defence declared that Yemeni militants had sent al-Shabab two boats filled with arms. They have also travelled to Somalia to fight.
        
        "Some elements went to Somalia. Some were killed there," said Rashad al-Alimi, Yemen's deputy prime minister for security and defence.
        
        Foreign Minister al-Qirbi, in an interview before the failed Christmas Day attack, urged Western nations to provide greater support for Yemen's coastguard to protect its shores from militants entering or leaving Yemen.
        
        "We also need better surveillance of refugees in the country," he said.
        
        Many Somali refugees refuse to leave their houses at night, fearing they will be picked up in a security sweep.
        
        "Nobody carries a Shabab ID. It's not written on our foreheads," said Ali, the community leader.
        
        "We have all become suspects."
        
        Most Somalis, he noted, practised a moderate form of Islam that stressed tolerance.
        
        At the Somali Refugee Council office in Sana'a, more than 20 refugees had reported losing their jobs in the past week, said Mohamed Abdi Gabobe, its chairman. The council, he said, was planning a demonstration to show solidarity with Yemen, in the hopes that this would lessen the pressure on the community.
        
        But many refugees are worried about their futures. They say they have become the latest victims in the US counter-terrorism campaign.
        
        "When two elephants fight each other, it is always the grass that is destroyed," said Sadat Mohamed Yusuf, a Somali community leader.
        
        "We are the grass."

    textlede: Six al-Qaeda extremists killed in air strike; Northern Yemen
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        SANAA - Six al-Qaeda extremists were killed in an air strike in northern Yemen yesterday in a stepped-up government campaign against the Islamist group.
        
        Yemen, which gained a reputation as a haven for al-Qaeda after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, came under the spotlight after crackdowns on the group in Pakistan and Afghanistan raised concern it was becoming a training and recruiting centre for extremists.
        
        "Two cars carrying eight dangerous al-Qaeda members were hit in an area between Saada and al-Jouf," a Yemeni security official said.
        
        "Two may have survived and escaped."
        
        "The group included Qassem al-Remi, Ayed al-Shabwani, Ammar al-Waeli and Saleh al-Teys," the official said. The four were wanted by the Yemeni and U.S. security services.
        
        "It is believed that Qassem al-Remi and Ayed al-Shabwani were killed in the air strike."
        
        Al-Shabwani was one of the most dangerous al-Qaeda members who provided a hideout for other militants at his farm in Maarib, where their training took place, the official said.
        
        Maarib is a mountainous eastern province where the oil and gas fields of major international companies are located.
        
        Gregory Johnsen, a Yemen scholar at Princeton University, said al-Remi's death, if confirmed, would be "a very, very significant blow against al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula," though it would not necessarily make the whole group crumble.
        
        "He is the most dangerous individual in the group based on his history, his statements and his role. He fought in Afghanistan and was central to rebuilding the organization and planning and conducting attacks."
        
        The security source in Yemen said Abu Ayman al-Masri, an Egyptian national known as Saleh al-Joufiin Yemen, was among the six killed today. He was the ideological brain of the group in Yemen.
        
        The government was also trying to negotiate the surrender of U.S.-Yemeni cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, said to have traded emails with the American army psychiatrist who killed 13 people at a U.S. army base in November, a government official said.
        
        Officials were in talks with members of al-Awlaki's tribe in remote Shabwa province where the cleric is believed to be hiding to persuade him to surrender in return for not handing him over to U.S. authorities, the official said.
        
        In December, Yemen said it might have killed al-Awlaki in an airstrike, but this was never confirmed.
        
        Yemen stepped up its operations against al-Qaeda after a Yemen-based wing of the group said it was behind an attempt to blow up a Detroit-bound U.S. airliner on Dec. 25 .
        
        The foiled bombing has focused attention on the growing prominence of al-Qaeda in Yemen and the expanding role of the U.S. military and intelligence agencies in fighting it.

    textlede: Focus energy - as well as cameras - on yemen; At the peak of the Christmas holiday season last year, the United States came close to experiencing yet another major terrorist-related catastrophe in the homeland.
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        This time, the attempt to blow up an airliner over Detroit by the Nigerian- born, London-educated, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab has led the international community to focus its attention and expanded counter-terrorism efforts on the Republic of Yemen, a relatively obscure Arab-Muslim country in the Arabian Peninsula.
        
        Historically, Yemen had been a vital strategic country for global maritime commerce during the 19th and early 20th centuries due to its location connecting the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. Today, its geography once again plays a major role in international affairs, although not at all in regards to commerce.
        
        Since October 2000, after the attack on the USS Cole warship in the port of Aden, the country has lost much of its status in maritime trade. Instead, Yemen finds itself at the crossroads of the growing transnational threat posed by Islamic-based terrorist networks like Osama bin Laden's al Qaida.
        
        At the end of the Cold War, Yemen became a major point of gravity for former Arab-Afghan Mujahadeen, veterans of the Afghan war against the Soviet Union. The return of hundreds of hardened, experienced fighters from Afghanistan by 1990, coupled with the repatriation of Yemenis from Saudi Arabia, created an environment vulnerable to influences from the conservative brand of Islam espoused by groups that grew out of the Afghan conflict in the 1980s.
        
        While such foreign influences infiltrating Yemen in the 1990s did not in themselves produce internal instability, the environment did allow jihadi networks to evolve and morph into the transnational threat we face today.
        
        Arab-Afghans and Yemeni migrant workers returned to Yemen, where central authority had not yet consolidated its control over the national territory following unification between North and South Yemen in 1990. Central authority was not able to deliver necessary services during a major economic crisis, nor was it able to oversee activities by Yemeni citizens in remote, mostly tribal, areas in the north and south.
        
        Although Yemeni jihadis had until recent times remained within government-related patronage networks, a number of them remained aligned to the post-Cold War transnational network created by Osama bin Laden.
        
        Since 1999, we have seen how al Qaida has been able to substitute traditional Yemeni patronage networks and shift allegiances to its cause, further permitting the influx of non-Yemeni extremists into Yemeni territory. It also provided a new destination after their defeat in Afghanistan, Algeria, Libya, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Somalia.
        
        As Fawaz Gerges, professor of middle eastern politics and international relations at the London School of Economics has mentioned, it is this presence of foreign al Qaida operatives which has now contributed to the evolution of Yemeni jihadis as part of the growing transnational network present in the Muslim world and western countries.
        
        The resurgence of Yemen in the news in connection with al Qaida is a consequence of a number of successes on the part of allied forces in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, as well as a number of failures in areas like Somalia. In addition, two major armed conflicts within Yemeni territory have recently contributed to the growth of al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and its influence throughout the country, as mentioned by Yemen's foreign minister, Dr Abu Bakr al-Qirbi.
        
        The fact that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have removed some safe havens for al Qaida's operatives deserves some attention, but now, since Western governments have ignored the ongoing crises in Yemen, we witness the negative consequences of myopic strategies in the "war on terror".
        
        A major issue for Yemen is the lack of sustained interest in the country on the part of western governments and non-governmental organisations. The spotlight on Yemen only shines when there is conflict, even though it has been suffering from major resources crises for more than two decades.
        
        Water is a major concern for the country, the economy is in collapse, and even a former Prime Minister has warned of an imminent famine. Last summer, the entire country suffered from major power outages that left people without electricity for up to six hours during the holy month of Ramadan. Even though Yemen is an oil producer, it has been unable to balance its oil production to provide basic services as well as reserve some product for the global market to subsidise its domestic budget. As a result of the global economic crises and the drop in oil prices, Yemen lost two thirds of its oil revenue in 2009.
        
        While some Yemenis figure as leaders within the al Qaida network, we have to admit that it is mainly driven by foreigners operating within Yemeni territory. Claims that Yemen has neglected AQAP's presence and activities are negated by the number of operations in recent years against many suspects.
        
        The government's failures to date result from a combination of inefficient capabilities and internal politics which protect some patronage networks as long as AQAP-affiliated terrorists do not directly target the regime in the capital, Sana'a.
        
        This may have changed as these terrorists now align themselves with other sources of instability that threaten the regime's survival.
        
        Prime Minister Gordon Brown's almost instant response to the Christmas Day events in the United States represents a major move by our Government to remain proactive in matters of counter-terrorism, as well as a positive move to respond to the conditions which led to the suspect's radicalisation and recruitment within the UK.
        
        While the events of the London bombing on July 7, 2005, clearly illustrated the transnational reach of the al Qaida network, Abdulmutallab's actions proved the continued resilience of the network in its operational threats. But most importantly, it showed its ability to recruit young men that no longer fit the established profile of a terrorist, and who are capable of reaching the homeland and rendering ineffective the security measures now implemented by western governments.
        
        The upcoming conference in London on January 28, hosted by Gordon Brown, focusing on Yemen will once again offer the international community a chance to remedy its mistakes and engage holistic approaches to solutions for Yemen's problems that can prevent the radicalisation of segments of the population against western interests.

    textlede: Yemen air strike part of stepped-up campaign
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Six al-Qaida militants were killed in an air strike in northern Yemen on Friday in a stepped-up government campaign against the Islamist group.
        
        Yemen, which gained a reputation as a haven for al-Qaida after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, came under the spotlight after crackdowns on the group in Pakistan and Afghanistan raised concern it was becoming a training and recruiting centre for militants.
        
        "Two cars carrying eight dangerous al-Qaida members were hit in an area between Saada and al-Jouf," a Yemeni security official told Reuters.
        
        "Two may have survived and escaped.
        
        "The group included Qassem al-Remi, Ayed al-Shabwani, Ammar al-Waeli, and Saleh al-Teys," the official said. The four were wanted by the Yemeni and U.S. security services.
        
        "It is believed that Qassem al-Remi and Ayed al-Shabwani were killed in the air strike."
        
        Al-Shabwani was one of the most dangerous al-Qaida members who provided a hideout for other militants at his farm in Maarib, where their training took place, the official said.
        
        Maarib is a mountainous eastern province where the oil and gas fields of major international companies are located.
        
        Gregory Johnsen, a Yemen scholar at Princeton University, said al-Remi's death, if confirmed, would be "a very, very significant blow against al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula," though it would not necessarily make the whole group crumble.
        
        "He is the most dangerous individual in the group based on his history, his statements and his role. He fought in Afghanistan and was central to rebuilding the organization and planning and conducting attacks."
        
        The security source in Yemen said Abu Ayman al-Masri, an Egyptian national known as Saleh al-Joufi in Yemen, was among the six killed. He was the ideological brain of the group in Yemen.
        
        The government was also trying to negotiate the surrender of U.S.-Yemeni cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, said to have traded emails with the American army psychiatrist who killed 13 people at a U.S. army base in November, a government official said.
        
        Officials were in talks with members of Awlaki's tribe in remote Shabwa province where the cleric is believed to be hiding to persuade him to surrender in return for not handing him over to U.S. authorities, the official said.
        
        In December, Yemen said it might have killed Awlaki in an air strike, but this was never confirmed.
        
        Yemen stepped up its operations against al-Qaida after a Yemen-based wing of the group said it was behind an attempt to blow up a Detroit-bound U.S. airliner on Dec. 25.
        
        The foiled bombing has focused attention on the growing prominence of al-Qaida in Yemen and the expanding role of the U.S. military and intelligence agencies in fighting it.
        
        The Yemeni interior ministry said co-operation with the United States would not extend to stationing U.S. troops on Yemeni soil.
        
        "The war on terrorism is ... to defend Yemen and its top interests," the ministry said in a statement.
        
        "The Yemeni-U.S. co-operation in this regard in limited to exchanging intelligence, providing Yemen's security apparatus with technological and military equipment, and assisting in training," it said.
        
        "This co-operation does not mean opening Yemen's doors for U.S. forces, or forces of any other country. Yemen's sovereignty is a red line."
        
        A group of Yemen clerics signed a statement after a meeting in Sanaa on Thursday saying Islam "requires all its followers to pursue jihad" if there were any foreign military intervention in the country.
        
        Yemen declared open war on al-Qaida on Thursday and warned citizens against aiding the global militant group. Troops were sent this week to join a drive against al-Qaida in three provinces.

    textlede: Why one Yemen provincial governor says he can't fight Al Qaeda; Ahmed al-Misri, a prominent member of President Saleh's ruling party, says he doesn't have enough weapons, soldiers, or aerial support to target Al Qaeda militants in his Abyan province.
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Ahmed al-Misri rues the day he took the job two years ago as governor of the southern Yemeni province of Abyan, fast emerging as a key battleground in the fight against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).In a frank assessment from his heavily guarded residence outside the regional capital of Zinjibar, Mr. Misri talks of his difficulties in reining in Al Qaeda when the central government in Sanaa is diverting troops to fight a rebellion in the north and a secessionist movement that is gaining ground in the south.
        
        "In all honesty, [government control] is not so strong," said Misri in an interview with four journalists attended by several local subgovernors and the regional army chief.
        
        "We don't have enough weapons, we don't have enough soldiers. Our resources are so stretched that if something happens in the countryside, we can't respond because there are no helicopters of airplanes."Misri, a member of the ruling party and close regional ally of President Ali Abdullah Saleh, is known for his outspoken views. But with troops and resources thinly spread on three different fronts, his appeals to the government appear to be falling on deaf ears.
        
        Yemen, the poorest country in the Arab world, has come under intense international pressure to show it reining in extremists after Al Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula claimed responsibility for the botched bombing of a Detroit-bound airliner on Dec. 25. The government has insisted it does not need US military intervention in its fight against the extremists, and has pointed to recent air and ground strikes that killed Al Qaeda members - including one today that Yemeni officials said killed six Al Qaeda militants - as proof that it is winning the battle. It has also claimed to bolster forces in regions where Al Qaeda is believed to be strongest, such as Abyan, a region with a population of roughly half a million. Misri said, however, there have been no reinforcements in his region. Instead, army chiefs have switched units in the north with those in the south, keeping numbers steady but giving the appearance of troop increases. When asked about Misri's claims, Yemeni Foreign Minister Abu Bakr al-Qurbi said he could not comment because it was a security matter. A Yemeni security official, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak on the issue, said that troops were needed in other provinces and would only be moved to Abyan if there was "a clear target."Al Qaeda makes inroads with cash, wells, AK-47sMany fear that Yemen is in danger of becoming a failed state. Along with Abyan, the regions of Shabwa and Marib are often cited as strongholds for AQAP.Local chiefs describe how deep in the mountains of Abyan, Al Qaeda militants move easily among the impoverished Bedouin villages, where unemployment is rife and the name of Al Qaeda unfamiliar to many. Misri says that Al Qaeda's presence in the region has grown in the past six to eight months, bolstered by financing brought over by Al Qaeda members from Saudi Arabia. Many Al Qaeda fighters have fled Saudi Arabia following a Saudi crackdown. When Yemen-based Al Qaeda formally merged its operations with the Saudi elements early last year, analysts said it provided an important boost to the organization. Although the group makes initial contact through a religious dialog, its members provide crucial services to local communities, distributing aid in the form of cash, AK-47s and help in building infrastructure, such as wells, said Misri."Say the government is paying someone $50, they will pay $100," he said.In return, they receive protection from the tribes and recruit foot soldiers to their cause, he said, citing local chiefs and officials based in these areas.Why villagers may turn blind eye to Al QaedaDecember air strikes, reported to be US-backed, had tragic consequences when - according to Misri's people - an entire village of mainly civilians was wiped out in a remote Bedouin village in Abyan. When a local chief navigated the mountain roads to reach al-Majalah several hours later, he found just five survivors - an elderly woman, three young girls, and a 16-year-old boy. According to Misri, 14 of those killed were Al-Qaeda. Another 45 were civilians. The strike has provoked deep anger among villagers, who are demanding an apology from the government.
        
        "If the government doesn't give a clear apology for what happened, people will turn a blind eye to the presence of Al Qaeda members," said Misri, adding that local leaders have offered their condolences. Taking the wheel of his jeep, Misri leads a security convoy formed of two pickups filled with soldiers and a police escort for a short tour of nearby Zinjibar. He claims that he is not worried about attacks on him as an act against him would be an act against his tribe. Just a few miles from his residence, he points out the bullet-scarred house of a prominent separatist leader, where a tense shootout last July left at least 12 dead.Misri: Aid imperative to ally tribes against AQAPIndeed, Misri is fighting a war on two fronts - the Al Qaeda threat and a separatist movement that seeks an independent South along the lines of the former British protectorate that later yielded to communist rule. Secessionists are seeking to throw off what they call a government "occupation" that treats southerners as second-class citizens. They accuse the government of ignoring the interests of the south and using its dwindling oil resources to benefit Saleh, who united North and South Yemen in 1990, and his inner circle. While the separatists say they seek a split through peaceful means, government authorities say several demonstrations have turned violent, with armed protesters setting up road blocks, stealing cars, and breaking into government offices. Misri estimates that unemployment stands at 50 percent in Abyan, considerably higher than the estimated national average of 40 percent. Unless international aid is forthcoming to tackle the root problems, the strength of resistance groups will grow, he warns.
        
        "We need more help to get the tribes to kick them [Al Qaeda] out," he said.
        
        "The government does not have the resources to do that."

    textlede: In Yemen, 158 clerics vow jihad if US military intervention broadens; The clerics' promise to wage jihad if the US boosts its military presence was an indirect message from President Saleh's government, said a senior Yemeni analyst. The clerics also noted positively a US effort to dampen fears of deeper military intervention.
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Prominent Islamist clerics in Yemen warned on Thursday that they would lead a jihad against any foreign forces that occupied their impoverished Arabian Peninsula nation to fight Al Qaeda militants there.Sending an explicit message to the US that it should not expand its already growing military and intelligence cooperation with Yemen to include ground forces, 158 clerics signed a statement to protest "dangerous developments and intrigues and conspiracies against the country."The clerics "absolutely reject" any foreign intervention, the establishment of foreign military bases on land or off the Yemeni coast, and the "killing of innocents" - a reference to the death of civilians in two US-backed air strikes against alleged Al Qaeda targets in December.
        
        "After all this," the statement said, "if there is any insistence from any foreign party or aggression or invasion against the country ... then Islam considers jihad a duty to repel the aggression" - a point that drew shouts of "God is great!" from the clerics when it was read out loud in a Sanaa mosque.Among those who spoke at the mosque was Sheikh Abdul-Majid al-Zindani, the influential Yemeni cleric labeled a "global terrorist" in Washington who was once close to Osama bin Laden.While the US has all but ruled out sending soldiers to Yemen, the clerics' message reflected widespread fear of a much larger intervention - even on the scale of Afghanistan or Iraq.
        
        "It is not just a popular message [to the US], but a message from the government in an indirect way," says Nasser Yehia, head of the Yemen Center for Strategic Studies in Sanaa.
        
        "I'm sure the Yemeni government had the same idea, but is afraid to state it. So it encourages popular groups to state it.""If US support is restricted as now, then the government will not be afraid. Intelligence support is secret, for example, so won't provoke any problem," adds Mr. Yehia, who says anything more would be problematic.
        
        "I believe the West shouldn't think about a big intervention, which would create a big problem. Only Iran and Al Qaeda would benefit from military intervention in Yemen."Clerics note US efforts to avoid stirSince the Al Qaeda offshoot in Yemen claimed responsibility for the plot by the Nigerian citizen Umar Farouk Mutallab to blow up a US aircraft on Christmas Day, with explosives sewn into his underwear, top American officials have stated that Islamic militants in Yemen are a global threat and one of their top priorities.While quiet American military and intelligence help and public declarations of support have surged in the past three weeks, President Barack Obama and his top commanders have also in recent days sought to dampen public fear of a much deeper military operation.The clerics acknowledged that, in the course of the two weeks they held deliberations, the White House and Pentagon had all but ruled out a broad troop deployment.The statement noted that clerics "appreciate this attitude of the US administration and demand that it abide by this policy."
        
        Clerics: Our 'duty' is doneClerics were confident they had done their "duty" to inform Yemenis. As they left the mosque, they were handed sticky-backed copies of the statement for posting.
        
        "This shows the West that the people of Yemen are wise, and deal with all issues with logic and reason," says Sheikh Ahmad Suleiman Ahyaf, head of the Islamic Studies Center in Sanaa, speaking after the meeting.
        
        "They want to show they can defend themselves. People reject any intervention.""This shows the Yemen government and people can resolve all their problems without the Americans," said Sheikh Morad al-Qadasi, who like most clerics at the meeting wore a traditional curved dagger in his belt.
        
        "The statement supports the government, and encourages it to solve all the problems. We believe that Al Qaeda is not as huge as imagined in the media.pagebreakClerics hold powerful sway in Yemen's tribal society. Their statement concluded with calls to be close to God. There were these words from the Koran: "Any disaster that befalls you is by your own hand."And there was a parable from the Koran, which told the fate of a village that was at first safe and secure, and enjoyed good living for a time.
        
        "But because it denied the blessings of God, [God] made it taste both hunger and fear."
        
        Military means not the only way to combat AQAPYemen is the poorest nation in the Arab world, and President Ali Abdullah Saleh's government has been weakened by a war against Houthi rebels in the north - which has absorbed half of Yemen's military force - and secessionist moves in the south. In addition, it faces rampant corruption, one of the world's most severe water shortages, and fast-dwindling oil reserves. Al Qaeda is just one more concern, albeit one that has increasingly targeted the regime in the past 18 months. An estimated 200 to 300 militants affiliated with Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), a 2009 merger between the Yemeni and Saudi offshoots of Al Qaeda, are believed to be active in Yemen. AQAP has become a key focus in Washington, and Yemeni security forces have stepped up attacks against Al Qaeda in recent months, making claims of numerous killings and arrests, though President Saleh - whose government has long had some ties to militants - last weekend called for dialogue with Al Qaeda.
        
        "Yemen says it is fighting Al Qaeda, but that does not only mean militarily," says Yehia, from the strategic studies center.
        
        "Last year, Afghanistan's president Hamid Karzai, and even some people in the US, said there should be dialogue with the Taliban and Al Qaeda. That didn't mean they were not serious in fighting them.""Security forces are launching a wide campaign against Al Qaeda elements, and we have an open war with them," a security official told Reuters. It reported that the Yemen Defense Ministry's online newspaper "September 26" quoted a security source saying the war was on against Al Qaeda militants "whenever or wherever we find those elements."

    textlede: Coming to Nigeria's Defence [opinion]
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        For many months to come, young Umar Farouk Abdumutallab's failed attempt to blow up an American passenger plane will dominate U.S.-Nigeria ties. Because of the Friday, December 25, 2009 incident, which would have resulted in over 290 passengers and crew, sent to their early graves, relations between two big democracies may suffer seriously.
        
        My guess is that the Federal Government of Nigeria will spend the next three or four months protesting sharply over a previously existing U.S.-compiled terror watch-list, so called, which the President Barak Obama administration expanded on January 3 to include Nigerian nationals traveling by air to the United States.
        
        In the foreseeable future, no one, realistically expects the government of the United States to remove Nigeria from the new travel rules, which have now begun to include long delays at airports, as well as extensive body searches. However, it is this writer's considered opinion that our country has no business being on that terrorism watch-list.
        
        It is also this writer's view that threatening to down-grade or weaken ties between our two countries cannot be the way to achieve our goal. The truth is: No administration in the U.S., not least any that has come to power since nine-eleven, will be able to retain public support, let alone backing from the powerful American legislature, called Congress, if, for whatever reason(s), it didn't expand this so-called new list of "enhanced security" to include the name of Nigeria, given the gravity of what Abdul Mutallab has done. That is one point.
        
        The other point is: The writer feels that the government of Nigeria has not done enough public condemnation of what the 23-year-old Nigerian national did. We may continue from today till eternity, arguing about how Mutallab was an impressionable, young man, and how he was brain-washed or indoctrinated outside the shores of our country, be it in Yemen, the U.K. or the U.S. Mrs. Dora Akunyili (our information minister), Ojo Maduekwe (our Foreign minister), the media in this country and the like may lament the profiling or humiliation of "150 million Nigerians" by America, because of the misbehaviour of a single person. Yet, the truth must be told: Mutallab acted in an unacceptable and horrendous manner. Not only did he mean to take his own life, but, he was hell-bent on destroying the lives of other human beings. Simply put, and Chief Olusegun Obasanjo has said as much, young Mutallab boarded a plane from Lagos, to Amsterdam and then, to Detroit, Michigan, U.S., with only one aim in mind: namely to terrorize and kill innocents. In all, 14 countries are on that list that requires increased screening of U.S.-bound passengers.
        
        The right way to go, in other words, is to try to make the Americans see reason, rather than continuing to adopt the Federal Government's tactics of threatening bilateral ties between our two countries. That, I dare say, never worked in the past, and will not work now. What the American government needs to understand, however, is that Nigeria, unlike every other country on the terrorism watch-list, has no history of international terrorism. One after another, let's place every other country one this watch-list alongside our country, and then make comparisons.
        
        Let's examine, first and foremost, countries in Africa that have been added to the list such as, Somalia, Algeria, Libya and Sudan. Somalia, situated along the horn of Africa, has been a failed state since 1990, when the overthrow of President Mohammed Siad Barre opened up anarchy and mayhem. Our country is not! Even as the simultaneous bombing of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 was masterminded by al Qaeda operatives based in Somalia.
        
        Nigeria is also not saddled with the kind of Islamic fundamentalism, exportable fundamentalism, that is, which has been ravaging Algeria since the annulled general elections of 1992. Extremists based there have also been attacking Western interests.
        
        Libya, for its part, has all along been on a longstanding U.S. list of supporters of international terrorism, which our country is not part of. And in Sudan's case, not only has the government there been viewed as anti-West since 1989, the Americans have long associated it as a terrorist haven, because it once played host to Osama Bin Laden and his clique.
        
        What is unique about the likes of Iran, Syria, Cuba and Afghanistan is that, like Libya, they are among the nations listed as state sponsors of terrorism. Not at all in Nigeria's category, every single one of these countries has had long years of apathy towards the U.S., and one-by-one, all of them are home to flourishing terrorist organizations or governmental institutions that have targeted the U.S. and other Western personnel.
        
        Not surprisingly, Lebanon is yet another country on the terror watch-list. While some people in the U.S. have used the machinations of Nigeria-based religious sects, such as Boku Haram, to justify their unsubstantiated claims that our country has begun breeding an exportable brand of Islamic fundamentalism, the truth remains that our country, a real plurality of faiths compared to every other country on the terror list, is no where near what the Hezbollah and other militant organisations has brought upon Lebanon. Not only is anti-Israel, anti-U.S. sentiments plentiful in many parts of Lebanon, but, till date, Lebanon remains the only country in the post-Cold War world, where over 200 U.S. military personnel were killed in a single (terrorist) attack.
        
        Although our country shares excellent ties with Washington, just like the governments of Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Yemen do, their governments, each and every one of them, are embroiled in a vicious counter-insurgency struggle, all of which involve Al Qaeda, and every single one of which the U.S. has committed so much money, time, energy and blood to.
        
        Yemen, for all that anyone should care, is home to A.Q.A.P., i.e. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, who turned out to be Mr. Mutallab's mentors; but also, everyone knows that there is an interlink between the ongoing conflict in Yemen and the Al Shabbab insurgency in Somalia.
        
        In much the same way, and virtually to the same extent, if not more, the Taliban-cum-Al Qaeda insurgencies in both Pakistan and Afghanistan are inextricably linked so much so that, together, both conflicts constitute just about the greatest threat to international peace and security.
        
        In fairness to the government of Nigeria, its reaction can only be interpreted as the reaction of a country that is multi-religious. The fact about our country is that the followers of the Islamic faith, to which Mutallab belongs, are only a plurality, and if you examine the length and breadth of the country, one will discover that half of Nigeria is, I dare say, muscularly Christian. As such, the irritation by Nigerians on account of our inclusion on the terrorism watch-list may be easy to understand.
        
        On top of that, we may have some justification in this country to feel that the U.S. government, despite all arguments to the contrary, has demonstrated some degree of double-standards in its handling of this matter. Not once, but, severally, Nigerians have reminded the Americans about the British man, Richard Reed, otherwise known as the "shoe-bomber". In the wake of nine-eleven, he had worn a shoe designed to explode into an aircraft en route to the U.S., only to be detected and restrained by co-passengers, until the plane landed. Except that Mr. reed, who admitted working for Al Qaeda, was tried and sentenced to life imprisonment in the U.S., British nationals have not been added to any terrorism watch-list; but, Nigerians have been, and people are asking questions: One set of rules for some: another set of rules for others?

    textlede: U.S. clamor over Qaeda may overstate its capability; Exaggerated coverage aids jihadists by creating an atmosphere of fear
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Politicians and the media have sounded the alarm in America: Be afraid. Al Qaeda is on the march. Your hapless government cannot protect you. But is overreacting actually helping the terrorists?
        
        FULL TEXT
        
        As terrorist plots against the United States have piled up in recent months, politicians and the news media have sounded the alarm with a riveting message for Americans: Be afraid. Al Qaeda is on the march again, targeting the country from within and without, and your hapless government cannot protect you.
        
        But the politically charged clamor has lumped together disparate cases and obscured the fact that the jihadist enemies on American soil in 2009, rather than a single powerful and sophisticated juggernaut, were a scattered, uncoordinated group of amateurs who displayed more fervor than skill.
        
        Their weapons were old-fashioned guns and explosives - in several cases, duds supplied by FBI informants - with no trace of the biological or radiological poisons, let alone the nuclear bombs, that have long been the ultimate fear.
        
        And though 2009 brought more domestic plots, and more serious plots, than any recent year, their lethality was relatively modest.
        
        Exactly 14 of the about 14,000 murders in the United States last year resulted from allegedly jihadist attacks: 13 people shot at Fort Hood in Texas in November and one at a military recruiting station in Little Rock, Arkansas, in June.
        
        Such statistics would be no comfort, of course, if an attack with mass casualties were to succeed some day. Nor do they excuse the acknowledged missteps at the bulked-up American security agencies that permitted a Nigerian student to carry a makeshift bomb onto a Detroit-bound airliner on Christmas Day - the attempted attack that set off the flood of news coverage.
        
        But even that near miss, said Mark M. Lowenthal, assistant director of the Central Intelligence Agency for analysis from 2002 to 2005, may offer indirect evidence of the enemy's diminished strength, compared with the coordinated attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
        
        "Sending one guy on one plane is a huge step down," Mr. Lowenthal said.
        
        "They're less capable, even if they're still lethal. They're not able to carry out the intense planning they once did."
        
        Counterterrorism experts inside and outside the government are intensely debating the meaning of the flurry of plots last year, and there is no settled consensus. Somalia and Yemen have emerged decisively as jihadist hot spots that may pose a direct threat to the United States. C.I.A. drone strikes in Pakistan's tribal areas have by no means ended the threat from there, as the Dec. 30 suicide bombing that killed seven C.I.A. employees in nearby Afghanistan grimly underscored.
        
        The Internet continues to prove a powerful tool for radicalization, as long-distance propagandists stir the ire of young Muslims about U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
        
        But Mr. Lowenthal and others who urge a calmer, more strategic assessment of the recent rash of violent schemes insist that the country is far safer than it was in 2001. They also argue that since the goal of terrorism is to spread terror, hyperbole about threats only does the extremists' work for them.

        FULL TEXT
        
        As terrorist plots against the United States have piled up in recent months, politicians and the news media have sounded the alarm with a riveting message for Americans: Be afraid. Al Qaeda is on the march again, targeting the country from within and without, and your hapless government cannot protect you.
        
        But the politically charged clamor has lumped together disparate cases and obscured the fact that the jihadist enemies on American soil in 2009, rather than a single powerful and sophisticated juggernaut, were a scattered, uncoordinated group of amateurs who displayed more fervor than skill.
        
        Their weapons were old-fashioned guns and explosives - in several cases, duds supplied by FBI informants - with no trace of the biological or radiological poisons, let alone the nuclear bombs, that have long been the ultimate fear.
        
        And though 2009 brought more domestic plots, and more serious plots, than any recent year, their lethality was relatively modest.
        
        Exactly 14 of the about 14,000 murders in the United States last year resulted from allegedly jihadist attacks: 13 people shot at Fort Hood in Texas in November and one at a military recruiting station in Little Rock, Arkansas, in June.
        
        Such statistics would be no comfort, of course, if an attack with mass casualties were to succeed some day. Nor do they excuse the acknowledged missteps at the bulked-up American security agencies that permitted a Nigerian student to carry a makeshift bomb onto a Detroit-bound airliner on Dec. 25, Christmas Day - the attempted attack that set off the flood of news coverage.
        
        But even that near miss, said Mark M. Lowenthal, assistant director of the Central Intelligence Agency for analysis from 2002 to 2005, may offer indirect evidence of the enemy's diminished strength, compared with the coordinated attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
        
        "Sending one guy on one plane is a huge step down," Mr. Lowenthal said.
        
        "They're less capable, even if they're still lethal. They're not able to carry out the intense planning they once did."
        
        Counterterrorism experts inside and outside the government are intensely debating the meaning of the flurry of plots last year, and there is no settled consensus. Somalia and Yemen have emerged decisively as jihadist hot spots that may pose a direct threat to the United States. C.I.A. drone strikes in Pakistan's tribal areas have by no means ended the threat from there, as the Dec. 30 suicide bombing that killed seven C.I.A. employees in nearby Afghanistan grimly underscored.
        
        The Internet continues to prove a powerful tool for radicalization, as long-distance propagandists stir the ire of young Muslims about U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
        
        But Mr. Lowenthal and others who urge a calmer, more strategic assessment of the recent rash of violent schemes insist that the country is far safer than it was in 2001. They also argue that since the goal of terrorism is to spread terror, hyperbole about threats only does the extremists' work for them.
        
        "We give comfort to our enemies," said Charles E. Allen, a 40-year C.I.A. veteran who served as the top intelligence official at the Department of Homeland Security from 2007 to early last year.
        
        Exaggerated news coverage and commentary, he said, "creates an atmosphere of tension and fear, and to me that's exactly the wrong way to go."

        "We're inadvertently building up the brand."
        
        In 2008, in his book "Leaderless Jihad," Marc Sageman, a psychiatrist and former C.I.A. officer who has long studied terrorism networks, wrote that Al Qaeda was in decline, to be replaced by dispersed terrorists for whom it provided mostly inspiration. The new generation of extremists, he said, would be less skilled and would likely pose less of a threat than the network responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks.
        
        Mr. Sageman said he saw no reason to revise that judgment today. The plots of the last year should be carefully analyzed and the findings used to improve counterterrorism, not turned into fuel for thoughtless anti-Muslim panic and discrimination, he said.
        
        "If we overreact and upset 1.5 billion Muslims," Mr. Sageman said, referring to the global total, "then we'll have a lot bigger problem on our hands."

        President Obama's pro-forma acceptance of responsibility for the latest failure to connect the dots in national security acknowledges Harry Truman's famous declaration that the buck always stops at the desk in the Oval Office.
        
        In purely political terms, its invocation invites voters if they choose to take out their wrath or disappointment on the president in the next election. But the mea culpa can also win support for the contrite leader who volunteers it, as the young President John F. Kennedy found in his first weeks in the White House.
        
        In a news conference after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba by U.S.-supported exiles in April 1961, JFK observed that, "there's an old saying that victory has a thousand fathers, but defeat is an orphan."
        
        Researchers never could find the genesis of that "old saying" and Kennedy reportedly later admitted he made it up.
        
        In any event, this particular "orphan" actually saw his public approval go up after taking the blame for the Bay of Pigs, which actually had been planned in the previous Eisenhower administration. Just prior to the invasion Kennedy had 78 percent support in the Gallup Poll, and it rose to 83 percent thereafter.
        
        As for the validity of JFK's "old saying," there's contradictory evidence in history that a president who suffers a defeat always bears the brunt of the ensuing criticism. Many histories of the Bay of Pigs fiasco have fingered the Joint Chiefs of Staff for cooking up an inadequate invasion plan, as well as charging that JFK got cold feet in failing to send air support to the overwhelmed exiles.
        
        Later, while publicly taking the blame, Kennedy privately castigated the CIA and heads rolled both there and at the Pentagon. The generals never quite regained his early confidence or at least reliance on them, and in the subsequent Cuban Missile Crisis he rebuffed the most belligerent advice from the likes of General Curtis LeMay, chief of staff of the United States Air Force.
        
        In the latest case of the buck formally stopping at President Obama's desk, and his mea culpa for the failure to connect the dots in the near miss at the Detroit airport, he is clearly not an "orphan" either. While no single culprit or even a few others have been identified, the president's orders for quick improvement are an acknowledgment not simply of "systemic" failure, but of human ineffectiveness.
        
        Obama's quickness in declaring there will be no finger-pointing at blame in his administration is a noble gesture. But it isn't likely to silence critical questions, and not only from Republican critics, about how nobody recognized the glaring red flags in this case and acted on them.
        
        The presidential orders for filling the gaps in the hugely difficult task of sorting out wheat from the chaff of millions of informational tidbits seem mostly in the realm of analytical belt-tightening. Long after the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission on connecting the dots were made, the system should have been adequately upgraded by now.
        
        The Christmas Day near miss, however, has been a stark reminder to the country that for all the focus on the war in Afghanistan, America's most legitimate adversary remains al-Qaida. And this latest incident has underscored that the terrorist threat from al-Qaida has spread well beyond the main military front in the Afghan-Pakistan region.
        
        What is now being identified as al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula broadens the challenge of keeping this country safe, and further validates Obama's decision in going forward in Afghanistan to identify al-Qaida as the prime target there and wherever else it exists.
        
        It's obvious that more attention now must be paid to Yemen, from which the so-called underwear bomber came, and to bolstering supportive governmental elements there. But the United States can't be diverted to any new nation-building missions.
        
        If nothing else has been achieved by Obama's taking responsibility for the close call on Christmas Day, he has emphatically rebuffed former Vice President Dick Cheney's ludicrous charge that he has been "trying to pretend we are not at war" against terrorism.

    textlede: SA decries "sport terrorism"
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        HIGHLIGHT: South Africa has launched an offensive to counter mainly European media reports and as well as what it considers unfounded concerns that an insurgent attack in Angola's Cabinda enclave has any relevance to the southern Africa state holding an incident-free soccer World Cup in June.
        
        National police commissioner Bheki Cele, who was in Angola at the weekend, yesterday vowed that "sport terrorism" would not stop the World Cup, the Independent group's newspapers as well as the SA Press Association report.
        
        Playing down worldwide security fears after the ambush of the Togolese soccer team's bus in the separatism-plagued enclave on Friday, Cele said the risk of the terror spilling over into South Africa was small. He said Cabinda was "hours from here" by plane.
        
        He returned yesterday morning from Angola, where he and President Jacob Zuma attended the opening match of the African Cup of Nations.
        
        Zuma has also played down fears, saying the attack took place in a known trouble spot. His spokesman, Vincent Magwenya, added that the country remains "100% ready" to host the World Cup.
        
        "He (Zuma) emphasised that the shocking and unacceptable attack on the Togolese team should not be blown out of proportion, but should serve as impetus for the African continent and the world at large to work even harder to rid the world of terrorist activity and violence wherever it surfaces."
        
        Unfair to compare SA,Angola
        
        Police Minister Nathi Mthethwa said yesterday it would be unfair to judge security in South Africa on the basis of the "fragility of the political situation in Angola".
        
        Cele said the World Cup in Germany four years ago had not been cancelled because of the bombings in Madrid, Spain, in 2004 and the bombs targeting the London commuter network in 2005.
        
        "The gaps that we could have noticed are closed in South Africa. We are (being meticulous about) the policing of the World Cup in South Africa," Cele said.
        
        Police had gained "extra understanding" of additional measures they should implement at stadiums.
        
        "We realised, [after the terrorist attack] that the gaps that could have been noticed were closed in South Africa. We are really fine."
        
        Describing the atmosphere in Angola immediately following the attacks, Cele said the mood was "a bit down generally in the country", but the international media's concern was primarily South Africa's readiness for the tournament in June and July.
        
        "There was a little bit of Cabinda, a lot of 2010 World Cup," he said.
        
        Many in the Togolese team had been keen to play, but because of "pressures back home" they had to withdraw, which gave "credit to the terrorists".
        
        Cele said it seemed that the separatists who launched the attack had not wanted to kill people, but merely to make "more noise".
        
        The head of the 2010 FIFA local organising committee (LOC), Danny Jordaan, described as "stupid" people who, after the attack in Cabinda, questioned South Africa's security measures for the World Cup.
        
        "It doesn't make sense. If a bomb went off in Spain, do you think I should call England to ask about what the impact is on the Olympics England is organising?" Jordaan said.
        
        He added on television this morning that Cabinda was about 3000km from SA, the same distance as London to Moscow. He asked rhetorically whether anyone would seriously state that security incidents in Russia and Europe over the next two years posed a threat to the 2012 London Olympics.
        
        "I think if something happens in France, you'll know it happened in France, not elsewhere."
        
        Angola "irresponsible"
        
        The Business Day this morning reports Institute for Security Studies (ISS) senior researcher and former police senior officer Dr Johan Burger as saying that the organisers of the African Nations Cup tournament were irresponsible in not arranging security escort services for teams travelling by road.
        
        Burger further said SA's security plans provided for security escort services during major events and could not be compared with most other African countries.
        
        "When we look at the police operational plans for big events, they provide escorting services arranged on a permanent basis," he said.
        
        "People must understand that SA is completely different from the situation that took place in Angola. Our country does not have liberation groups (rebels) that are fighting now and then and any threat of this nature would be taken care of by the intelligence services," he said.
        
        The business daily also quoted LOC spokesman Rich Mkhondo as saying the incident in Angola would not affect preparations for the World Cup.
        
        "We're working with the local and international agencies to prepare for any eventuality. There are some simulations going on around the country between the partners who are in charge of security, the police and the army," he said.
        
        Earlier, LOC chairman Irvin Khoza said the challenge posed by the attack was the misconception that Africa was a country, not a continent with many different countries.
        
        Sport attracts terrorists
        
        Reuters also reported that "while any major sporting event could attract publicity-seeking action by extremists", South Africa and Angola were totally different.
        
        "South Africa has a very effective security apparatus, probably the most effective in southern Africa," it quoted Sajjan Gohel, international security director of a London think tank, the Asia-Pacific Foundation,as saying.
        
        "But all it requires is one particular terrorist event that could create huge disruption to the tournament itself ... It would be totally naive to assume South Africa would be either immune or exempt from it."
        
        Although Gohel and Reuters did not mention it, the intersection of terror and sport date back to at least 1972 when Palestinian militants attacked Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics.
        
        Partly because such dangers are taken so seriously, security planning began in 2004, Reuters added.
        
        "We have got our plans in place, both pro-active and reactive plans," said Senior Superintendent Vishnu Naidoo, the national police spokesman for the World Cup.
        
        South Africa has hosted other major sporting events successfully, including the Cricket World Cup in 2003 and the Rugby World Cup in 1995.
        
        Reuters added that analysts had told it sufficient measures had been taken to ensure the safety of teams, and the tens of thousands of expected fans.
        
        "We have been following police preparations for the World Cup very closely and we are very impressed with the security measures," said Jakkie Cilliers, executive director of the ISS.
        
        Gohel added that terrorism has become the bane of sports events.
        
        "Pakistan have become sporting pariahs, nobody plays there."
        
        Gohel said the magnitude of the soccer World Cup made it an attractive target for militants seeking maximum publicity.
        
        "For the last three World Cups terrorist groups have thought about carrying out an attack but they haven't been successful, they have had their own logistical and technical problems," he said.
        
        SA not immune
        
        "It would be totally naive to assume South Africa would be either immune or exempt from it. It is very worrying sporting events are being hijacked in this way."
        
        The major headache for organisers is the ease with which a sporting event can be disrupted even if the attacks do not go according to plan. A soccer World Cup is also logistically easier to target because it is not confined to one city as are the summer and winter Olympics, Reuters noted.
        
        Security is going to be a major problem at the New Dehli Commonwealth Games in October following the militant attacks in Mumbai in 2008 which killed 166 people.
        
        An England badminton team withdrew from the world championships in Hyderabad and the Australian Davis Cup tennis side refused to play in Chennai.
        
        "I believe the threat to the Commonwealth Games is very serious because we saw how the Mumbai gunmen were able to hold an entire city hostage for several days," Gohel said.
        
        "We saw how it created panic, it captured the headlines, it precipitated fear we haven't seen since the 9/11 attacks, it was being beamed into our homes from the international media."
        
        In addition, US intelligence think-tank Stratfor did last week warn in its "Jihadism in 2010" analysis that Somali insurgents were a rising threat to SA. They noted that the main Jihadist group there, al-Shabaab, in September last year declared itself allied to al-Qaeda. It also questioned whether the group would this year decide to use its contacts within the Somali diaspora to conduct attacks in East Africa, South Africa, Australia, Europe and the United States.
        
        "We believe that al Shabaab is on its way to becoming a transnational player and that 2010 may well be the year that it breaks out and then draws international attention like [al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula] has done in recent months."
        
        The US closed its embassy and consulates in SA for three days last September allegedly because of a threat from Somali militants. SA has growing Somali population that is frequently the victim of xenophobic violence. Alienated and antagonised members of this community may well cooperate with militants to strike at western or other targets in the country. The same could be argued for the Pakistani diaspora in SA,which has also dramatically increased in recent years. British authorities have in recent years intercepted a number of Pakistani militants that had transitted through SA and who were in possession of irregularly issued SA travel documents. It is known that these and other Jihadi militants have used SA as a "safe harbour."
        
        Reuters noted some teams - including the United States and England - are seen as potential targets for Islamic militant groups out to strike at the West.
        
        SA faced an indigenous Jihadist threat between 1996 and 2002 in the form of the mostly-Cape Town-based People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (PAGAD). The militant group initially targetted drug dealers and gangsters, reportedly murdering several, in the notoriously-crime ridden Cape Flats but then branched into more seditious activity. An urban terrorism campaign that included pipe bombings started in 1998, and according to the wikipedia included nine bombings in 2000 alone. In addition to targeting gang leaders, bombing targets included South African authorities, moderate Muslims, synagogues, gay nightclubs, tourist attractions, and Western-associated restaurants. The most prominent attack during this time was the bombing on 25 August 1998 of the Cape Town Planet Hollywood.
        
        In September 2000, magistrate Pieter Theron, who was presiding in a case involving PAGAD members, was murdered in a drive-by shooting. PAGAD was also accused of anti-semitic statements and a petrol bomb attack on a Jewish bookshop owner.
        
        Violent acts such as bombings and vigilantism in Cape Town subsided in 2002, and the police have not attributed any such acts to PAGAD since the November 2002 bombing of the Bishop Lavis offices of the Serious Crimes Unit in the city. The police and National Intelligence Agency later took credit for ending the violence.
        
        Too early for Angola?
        
        Former World Cup-winning coaches Franz Beckenbauer and Marcello Lippi told the anadian Press they remain confident that South Africa will put on a peaceful tournament.
        
        "Of course, the shock at the terrible events sits deep," said Beckenbauer, three days after three people were killed and two Togo players were wounded in the attack on the team.
        
        "But it would be a mistake if we Europeans lumped together South Africa and Angola.
        
        "Perhaps the African Cup came a bit too early for Angola," Beckenbauer, who coached West Germany to the World Cup title in 1990 and won as a player in 1974, told the German daily Bild.
        
        Angola has only recently overcome decades of violence, and the country's government was hoping the biennial continental championship would give it a chance to show the world it was on the way to recovery - much like South Africa is trying to prove itself after decades of apartheid kept that country racially segregated.
        
        The first World Cup to be played on African soil will open June 11 with host South Africa facing Mexico at Soccer City in Johannesburg. The final is scheduled for July 11 at the same stadium. An estimated 450,000 fans will visit the country for the 32-team, month-long tournament at 10 venues in nine cities across the country.

    textlede: Somalis in Yemen prompt new worry; Officials fear flow of refugees could bolster al-Qaeda affiliate
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Thousands of Somali boys and teenagers fleeing war and chaos at home are sailing to Yemen, where officials who have long welcomed Somali refugees now worry that the new arrivals could become the next generation of al-Qaeda fighters.
        
        As the United States deepens its counterterrorism operations in Yemen, officials are concerned that extremists could find growing Somali refugee camps fertile ground for recruiting. U.S. and Yemeni authorities also fear that Islamist fighters from Somalia could slip into the country among the throngs of refugees, deepening ties between al-Qaeda leaders in Yemen and the particularly hard-line militants of Somalia.
        
        Fleeing a failed state for a failing one, the Somali youths arrive daily in this refugee outpost, which is filled with rickety tents and tales of misery, in the vast desert of southern Yemen. They bring stories of brutality and forced conscription by al-Shabab, an Islamist force battling Somalia's U.S.-backed transitional government.
        
        "They ordered us to fight the nonbelievers," said Abdul Khadr Salot, 19, a burly ex-fighter with a thin scar across his cheek who escaped from a militant training camp.
        
        "Even if your father tells you to leave the Shabab, you must kill him."
        
        But this longtime haven is becoming increasingly inhospitable since the United States bolstered its operations here, largely in response to the Yemeni al-Qaeda connections of the Nigerian man who allegedly tried to bomb a U.S. airliner over Detroit on Christmas Day, and to the links of an extremist Yemeni American cleric to the Nov. 5 shootings at Fort Hood, Tex.
        
        Yemen's fragile government fears that Somali fighters from al-Shabab will swell the ranks of Yemen's Islamist militants at a time when links between the Somali group and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula are growing, according to Yemeni officials and analysts.
        
        As it quietly wages war against extremists in the Arabian Peninsula and parts of Africa, the Obama administration could find itself confronting a unified, regional al-Qaeda on two continents. This would further stretch U.S. resources as Washington fights major conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. It could also push Yemen -- beset by mounting internal strife, poor governance, extreme poverty and dwindling resources -- even deeper into a downward spiral.
        
        "Somalia for Yemen is becoming like what Pakistan is for Afghanistan," said Saeed Obaid, a Yemeni terrorism expert who wrote a book on al-Qaeda's Yemen affiliate.
        
        Leaders of al-Shabab, which the United States has labeled a terrorist organization with links to al-Qaeda's central body, said last week that they will send fighters to help al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. That prompted Yemeni Foreign Minister Abu Bakr al-Qirbi to issue a stern warning through the state-run Saba news agency that Yemen will not allow "any terrorist elements from any country to operate in its territory."
        
        In recent days, Yemeni security forces have staged raids on Somali refugee communities, detaining suspected loyalists of al-Shabab, which means "The Youth."
        
        Overnight, an atmosphere of fear has gripped the community, which numbers more than 1 million.
        
        "The climate has changed, and it is heating up," Mohammed Ali, a top leader of the Somali community in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, lamented over a glass of Somali coffee.
        
        An estimated 74,000 African refugees, mostly from Somalia and Ethiopia, arrived in Yemen last year, 50 percent more than in 2008, according to statistics from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. UNHCR officials say 309 either drowned in capsized boats or were killed by smugglers.
        
        Forced recruitment
        
        In September, a gang of al-Shabab fighters grabbed 14-year-old Saber Ahmed at his father's shop in Mogadishu, the Somali capital.
        
        They blindfolded him and took him to a nearby militia base, he said. There, they brought out recruits he knew from his neighborhood, who urged him to join. The peer pressure didn't work. Then, an al-Shabab commander gave him an ultimatum.
        
        "He said, 'We will kill you if you don't join us,' " recalled Ahmed, tall and lanky with a soft voice and chiseled face.
        
        After 20 days of training, he was sent to the front lines. Within hours, he said, a battle erupted; Ahmed was shot in the leg. He managed to crawl to his house. His father took him to a hospital. When Ahmed regained consciousness, his father gave him $100 and ordered him to flee to Yemen.
        
        In the Somali port of Bossaso, he handed the money to a smuggler, who placed him on a crowded boat headed for a treacherous sea. As the boat neared Yemen, it flipped over. Ahmed swam nearly a mile to the shore. He later learned that seven passengers had drowned.
        
        Ahmed's experience is a familiar one, according to Somali community leaders and officials at the UNHCR, which runs the camp here in Kharaz. Parents often say they bring their children to Yemen to prevent them from one day joining al-Shabab.
        
        "It's very easy to brainwash youth. They tell them, 'We'll give you money. We'll give you power,' " said Rocco Nuri, a UNHCR official in Aden.
        
        When told that former al-Shabab fighters were in Kharaz, Nuri expressed concern but said it was "impossible to monitor this" in an open camp where residents come and go freely. Nevertheless, he expressed confidence that the camp is not a haven or recruiting hub for Somali militants.
        
        In Yemen, Somalis are worse off than Yemenis. Jobs are scarce. Thousands of Somali youths eke out a living washing cars. They sleep under trees and bathe in public water tanks. Most Somali refugees view Yemen as a transit point to richer nations such as Saudi Arabia. But in recent months, a war between the Yemeni government and Shiite Hawthi rebels in the north has stemmed the migration.
        
        Salafist schools, which teach a puritanical brand of Islam, have attracted several hundred young Somali refugees with offers of free food and lodging, said Somali community leaders. They fear some could join al-Shabab.
        
        "Some boys did return back to Somalia," said Deka Muhamed, a Somali elder in Sanaa.
        
        "We've heard they've been killed, but we don't know how or why."
        
        Yemeni officials, meanwhile, worry that al-Qaeda could lure Somali ex-fighters into their ranks with promises of money or aid. But so far, there has been no evidence of this, say Western diplomats and Yemeni officials.
        
        In an audiotape last year, Osama bin Laden exhorted al-Shabab to overthrow the Somali government. Radical Yemeni American cleric Anwar al-Aulaqi, whom the United States has linked to the suspect in the attempted Christmas Day bombing and to the gunman charged in the massacre at Fort Hood, has also expressed support for al-Shabab.
        
        Yemeni officials and analysts say there is regular communication between al-Qaeda militants in Yemen and al-Shabab. Last week, Somalia's state minister for defense declared that Yemeni militants had sent al-Shabab two boats filled with arms. They have also traveled to Somalia to fight.
        
        "Some elements went to Somalia. Some were killed there," said Rashad al-Alimi, Yemen's deputy prime minister for security and defense.
        
        Foreign Minister Qirbi, in an interview before the failed Christmas Day attack, urged Western nations to provide greater support for Yemen's coast guard to protect its shores from militants entering or leaving.
        
        "We also need better surveillance of refugees in the country," he said.
        
        'All become suspects'
        
        Many Somali refugees refuse to leave their houses at night, fearing they will be picked up in a security sweep.
        
        "Nobody carries a Shabab I.D. It's not written on our foreheads," said Ali, the community leader.
        
        "We have all become suspects."
        
        Most Somalis, he noted, practice a moderate form of Islam that stresses tolerance.
        
        At the Somali Refugee Council office in Sanaa, more than 20 refugees have reported losing their jobs in the past week, said Mohamed Abdi Gabobe, its chairman. The council, he said, is planning a demonstration to show solidarity with Yemen, in the hopes that this will lessen the pressure on the community.
        
        But many refugees are worried about their futures. They say they have become the latest victims in the U.S. counterterrorism campaign.
        
        "When two elephants fight each other, it is always the grass that is destroyed," said Sadat Mohamed Yusuf, a Somali community leader.
        
        "We are the grass."

        FULL TEXT
        
        As the Obama administration confronts the latest terrorism threat in Yemen, its diplomatic and development efforts are being constrained by a shortage of resources, a lack of in-house expertise and a fraught history with a Yemeni leader deeply ambivalent about American help.
        
        U.S. officials said they focused on Yemen as a hothouse for Islamic terrorism from the day President Barack Obama took office.
        
        The United States has tripled its foreign assistance to the country from 2008 levels and plans to spend up to $63 million on Yemen this year.
        
        But by all accounts, that is a modest amount for a country that is suddenly a central threat on the foreign-policy landscape; it is roughly the same amount the United States sends to Serbia. It illustrates how much the United States is stretched on the foreign policy front, and how hard it is to extend its resources beyond the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
        
        Beyond providing military and intelligence help - showcased in recent airstrikes on training sites for Al Qaeda - the administration has yet to develop a coherent plan for dealing with Yemen's pervasive poverty and corruption, according to former diplomats and outside experts. Those ills, they say, are at the root of Yemen's lure for terrorists.
        
        "I don't think we have a strategy for Yemen; I think we have some responses," said Edmund J. Hull, the U.S. ambassador there from 2001 to 2004.
        
        "It's difficult to do because the problems in Yemen are so huge that you almost get stopped before you start."
        
        In an overburdened State Department, there are only a handful of Yemen experts, compared with 30 people from nine government agencies who are assigned just to the administration's special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard C. Holbrooke.
        
        Washington's limited insight into Yemen was on display Thursday, when the White House's chief counterterrorism adviser, John O. Brennan, expressed surprise that Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was sophisticated enough to carry out a plot against an American jetliner. In fact, Mr. Brennan, a former C.I.A. station chief in neighboring Saudi Arabia, is widely regarded as one of the administration's most knowledgeable officials about the country.
        
        "It's not that Yemen is the most mysterious and unknowable country in the world," said Micah Zenko, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
        
        "One needs to ask why more wasn't done sooner."
        
        The State Department said it had decided to step up its engagement with Yemen even before the botched Dec. 25 attack on the jetliner. In September, the United States signed an agreement with the Yemeni government for a three-year, $120 million "stabilization program," devised to create jobs and improve health and other public services on an accelerated timetable.
        
        "We wanted to put together a package of quick-impact projects that would give people a sense that their lives are improving," said Janet A. Sanderson, a deputy assistant secretary of state who oversees Yemen.
        
        After the U.S. Navy destroyer Cole was bombed in Yemen in 2000, the United States embarked on a similar effort. In addition to focusing on counterterrorism operations, the State Department helped finance projects like a health clinic on the rugged highway between the capital, Sana, and Marib, a town in a remote region where Qaeda forces are known to cluster.
        
        Improving health care is one way to make Yemenis less receptive to Al Qaeda and other extremists, Mr. Hull said. The United States had previously tended to focus its economic aid on politically influential places like Sana and Aden, the port city where the Cole was attacked.
        
        From 2002 to 2004, officials said, Qaeda elements in Yemen were on the defensive.
        
        But U.S. relations with Yemen soured after several Qaeda suspects escaped from a prison in Sana in 2006. After the release of a high-profile Qaeda operative in 2007, Washington cut aid that Yemen was supposed to get through the Millennium Challenge program.
        
        "You had this reversal and downward trend in relations," Mr. Hull said.
        
        "Both we and they took our eyes off the ball."
        
        By 2008, nonmilitary aid to Yemen had dwindled to less than $20 million. Afghanistan is expected to receive $2.7 billion a year in nonmilitary aid, Pakistan $1.5 billion and Iraq $500 million.
        
        The administration doubled Yemen's economic aid last year, but as Barbara K. Bodine, another former ambassador, pointed out, the amount "works out to $1.60 per Yemeni."
        
        "That won't even buy you a cup of coffee in Yemen," she added, "and they invented coffee."

    textlede: Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula; A primer on the organization that gave us the Christmas bomber
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        On a February morning in 2006, as Sana'a, the capital of Yemen, was jolted awake by the calls to prayer from the city's mosques, 23 Yemeni prisoners crawled their way to freedom.
        
        They had spent weeks patiently digging a 140-foot tunnel that would extend from their basement prison cell to a nearby mosque. Among the escapees were Jamal al-Badawi, the alleged mastermind of the 2000 USS Cole bombing that killed 17 American sailors, and Jaber al-Banna, a Yemeni with U.S. citizenship who was counted among the FBI's 26 most wanted.
        
        There was widespread speculation that the men had help from both inside the prison and out, only fueling fears about Yemen's revolving doors of justice. It wasn't the first time al-Badawi had escaped.
        
        President Ali Abdullah Saleh's government vowed swift action, and while almost all of the prisoners, including al-Badawi and al-Banna, were later recaptured or killed, two of the lesser-known escapees eluded authorities.
        
        Those men, Qasim al-Raimi and Nasser al-Wahishi, a 33-year-old former jihadist who fought alongside Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, disappeared into the largely autonomous tribal region outside Sana'a.
        
        In the four years since, they've helped build what is known today as Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, the Yemen-based group which was thrust into the spotlight following the botched Christmas Day bombing of a Detroitbound passenger jet. Nigerian suspect Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab claims that he received training and the explosives used in the attempted attack from the group during his travels to Yemen.
        
        Though it may seem that AQAP has suddenly emerged as al-Qaeda's newest and most virulent branch, the organization has increasingly been demanding the attention of intelligence agencies.
        
        "The group's growing ambition and increasing strength really shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone who has been paying attention," says Princeton's Gregory Johnsen, one of the U.S.'s foremost experts on Yemen.
        
        "Just because people in the West haven't been focused on Yemen, doesn't mean al-Qaeda has not been active there."
        
        In August, the group narrowly failed to assassinate Saudi Arabia's security chief, in a plot bearing similarities to the Christmas Day attack. The 23-year-old suicide bomber was on a Saudi most wanted list but managed to persuade officials that he was ready to repent and surrender directly to Prince Mohammed bin Nayef. He was even brought to see Nayef aboard the prince's private plane, apparently concealing the bomb in his rectum.
        
        The bomber was the only one killed when the explosives were detonated (reportedly by a cellphone, but accounts of the attack have varied). He did, however, manage to get close enough to injure Nayef in the blast.
        
        Yemen has had a long and complicated relationship with al-Qaeda, stemming back to the late 1980s when Arab veterans of the war against the Soviets in Afghanistan were welcomed back as heroes. In the conservative country, where bin Laden remains a popular figure, Saleh's government has always understood the importance of co-operating with Islamic leaders, and keeping the Arab-Afghan jihadists close. In 1994, four years after Saleh was proclaimed the President of the newly unified north and south, many of those fighters were dispatched to stop a southern attempt to separate.
        
        President Saleh was, however, among the first foreign leaders to pledge his support to the Bush administration following
        
        the 9/11 attacks -- a position he made clear during a November 2001 visit to Washington. A year later, an unmanned CIA drone killed the head of Yemen's al-Qaeda branch. Shortly thereafter, his replacement was arrested. While Saleh paid a high price at home for allowing the U.S. strike, the loss of the group's leaders, in addition to the war in Iraq that attracted hundreds of Yemeni jihadists, made it appear in 2003 as if al-Qaeda had been largely defeated in the country.
        
        But three years later, al-Wahishi took advantage of the lapsed vigilance by the American and Yemeni forces and built his group. As Saleh's government tried to quell a northern insurgency and a secession movement in the south (still regarded in Yemen as far greater threats to the country's stability than al-Qaeda), al-Wahishi's group waged attacks on local oil and gas facilities.
        
        In June 2007, a suicide bomber targeted Spanish tourists, and six months later two Belgians were killed when gunmen ambushed their vehicles. A series of other strikes followed, culminating in the September 2008 suicide bombings of the U.S. Embassy in Sana'a that killed 18, including the six assailants. Meanwhile, Saudi fighters were increasingly bolstering the group's ranks, since many had fled south across the border following Saudi Arabia's heavy-handed crackdown on extremists.
        
        The Saudi and Yemeni branches of al-Qaeda made their "merger" official in January, adopting the name Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. A Jan. 23 video broadcast on an al-Qaeda website identified the new Saudi leaders as Said Ali al-Shihri, a 35-year-old former Guantanamo Bay detainee who had been released in November 2007, and Abu Hareth Muhammad al-Awfi, identified on the video as Guantanamo detainee 333.
        
        Embarrassingly for both Saudi Arabia and the U.S., due to past praise of the Kingdom's handling of al-Qaeda, the AQAP leaders had both participated in the well-funded Saudi rehabilitation program. Though al-Awfisurrendered to Saudi authorities a month later, al-Shihri is still an important figure within the group.
        
        AQAP represents what many consider Yemen's second generation of al-Qaeda -- and while the group may have ties to "al-Qaeda central," the organization appears to act independently. Counterterrorism officials believe AQAP has learned from its recent past and built an organization that can withstand the loss of its leadership. Savvy in delivering its message, the group even has its own magazine, Salah al Malahim ( The Echo of Battle), which covers everything from biographies of suicide bombers to advice columns on how to become an al-Qaeda foot soldier.
        
        Reports on AQAP's membership vary widely, with some Yemeni security experts saying they number no more than 50, while others believe there are more than 200 operatives in the country. Most of their goals still seem to remain local, as reflected in their statement following the Christmas Day attack that warned all non-Muslims in the Arabian Peninsula that they were at risk.
        
        President Saleh faces huge challenges. He continues to struggle with crushing domestic woes, and he's simultaneously trying to attain a diplomatic balance between supporting the U.S.'s demands for action without appearing to be a puppet. His government also has limited influence in the tribal areas outside of Sana'a where AQAP has set up its base. Yemen's foreign affairs minister said he feared that situation wouldn't change until Yemenis stopped turning to their tribal leaders to provide what the government cannot.
        
        "Yemen cannot really build a modern state unless we re-define the role of government," Abu Baker al-Qirbi argued when we talked in his office this summer about the rise of AQAP.
        
        "If one spends a fraction of the money that is spent on combating terrorism, on how to rehabilitate and how to address some of the issues that lead to extremism -- education and poverty -- maybe we would have achieved a greater success in fighting terrorism."

        AMERICANS were understandably appalled at the security lapses that led to the Christmas Day terror scare on a Northwest Airlines flight to Detroit. Indeed, President Barack Obama s anger was still evident [days later], as he said the existing system failed in a potentially disastrous way because U.S. officials failed to connect the dots.
        
        But is the answer to turn 630 million people from 14 mainly Muslim countries into terror suspects? Washington now regards Nigeria, Pakistan and a dozen other nations as security sieves.
        
        Before they can fly to the U.S., people with passports from these countries will now face full-body pat-downs and their carry-on baggage will be searched. So will anyone on flights that take off from these countries, or that pass through them. And it doesn t end there. Canadians flying to the U.S. from Pearson Airport after the Christmas scare have had to endure similar screening and delays.
        
        Obama defended the new national profiling net and other security measures \.\.\. . But it remains to be seen whether they are the best response to a single, if serious, scare the botched bid to blow a Northwest jet out of the air. Police have charged Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a 23-year-old Nigerian who claims Al Qaeda ties\.\.\. .
        
        Better screening would require better-trained airport staff. But that makes more sense than having poorly trained staffers giving every single passenger a quick once-over. To a trained expert, Abdulmutallab s cash purchase of a one-way ticket and his lack of checked luggage might well have triggered the alarms that could have stopped him from boarding.
        
        THE TORONTO STAR
        
        U.S. PRESIDENT Barack Obama has sharply criticized the failure of the intelligence agencies in analyzing and integrating available information, thus leading to the recently attempted terror attack.
        
        The official reaction follows the foiled terror attack on a Detroit bound U.S. airliner by Nigerian national Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab on Christmas Day. More significant is the President s decision to suspend the return of Yemeni nationals detained at Guantánamo. The fact that Abdulmutallab has claimed to have received training by al-Qaida affiliates in Yemen has notched up the alarm level in the United States about the impoverished Gulf state, currently battling sectarian and separatist groups besides a resurgent al-Qaida. Not only does this highlight the precarious security situation in Yemen, it bears directly on the earlier decision to close the detention facility by the end of this month.
        
        The decision to suspend further transfer of the 92 Yemeni nationals detained at Guantánamo to their home country is but a natural outcome of the current scenario. Factors that led to the decision are as follows: the rising influence and activities of a resurgent al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (as it is now known); Abdulmutallab s connection to al-Qaida in Yemen; the danger of exposing any more returning detainees to al-Qaida influence; previous experiences in Yemen where key terror targets escaped detention to form resurgent terror cells\.\.\. .
        
        But given the nature of the threat and the adaptive means of terror groups to work around existing security preventives, these new measures will have to be tolerated. The question is, will these measures, meant primarily for the United States, be integrated in international travel prerequisite checks and implemented internationally?
        
        KHALEEJ TIMES (Dubai)
        
        EVEN after a decade of watching al-Qaida inflict evil all over the world, it is impossible not to be alarmed by its appalling opportunism. There is no place on the planet where Osama bin Laden or any of his acolytes could raise their standard with any hope of attracting popular support. So al-Qaida attaches itself to other people s causes, using them as a cloak to plan mayhem and misery. There is no doubting the importance of Islam in Afghanistan and the religious faith of members of the Taliban [among those] who defeated the Soviet Union and its client regime. But ever since, they have been in an uneasy alliance with al-Qaida, who brought the wrath of the United States down on them after September 11, 2001. Now al-Qaida operatives have placed Yemen under a similar spotlight.
        
        As in Afghanistan, the terrorists are attempting to take over a domestic war, which may have a religious dimension but certainly not of the kind al-Qaida imposes. In Yemen, Shia people in the impoverished north are in rebellion against the Sunni government in the south. As usual in such struggles, theology comes a distant second to geopolitics and regional powers are using the rebellion to suit their own interests. The Saudis are assisting the government and there are allegations that Shia Iran is helping its co-religionists.
        
        But there is no doubt al-Qaida operatives are using the mayhem to impose their clerical code on the country s north, and use it as a new base to recruit and train terrorists\.\.\. .

    textlede: Money talks louder than al-Qaeda in Yemen; British rule in Aden may be remembered with affection but we should not forget how the Yemenis wrongfooted us in 1967
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        The Prime Minister's decision to host an urgent international conference on Yemen at the end of the month will have surprised many. Britain certainly needs to pull its weight in Pakistan and in its former colonial possessions in Africa, for example, but why in Yemen? Because Britain is better equipped than anyone to understand how fragile the country has become, how much tension has been generated by the mismanaged union in 1990 of the formerly Marxist south with the military-tribal republic of the north and how easily a fragmentation of the country could play into al-Qaeda's hands.
        
        Before 1967 when the south became Marxist-ruled and Soviet-backed, that same south was under British rule. But it went by different names, none of them Yemeni; small wonder so few of us connect Yemen with Aden.
        
        Captured by force in 1839, the colony of Aden with its valuable port did duty as a link in the chain of naval fortresses that allowed Britannia to rule the waves. Aden's wild tribal hinterland, meanwhile, dubbed the Eastern and Western Aden Protectorates (EAP and WAP), served as a buffer-zone against northern Yemenis, who always resented the presence of Crusader infidels so close to Islam's holy places.
        
        Time was, therefore, when the British were entirely at home in the now obscure and excessively jihadist-friendly southern and eastern reaches of the state that is Yemen today. For the 128 years that we ran sweltering Aden to mutual economic advantage, and the surrounding tribal lands to the advantage of no one much, this stretch of the Arabian peninsula - affectionately referred to by British expats as "the arsehole of the Empire" - was as familiar to us as Northern Ireland.
        
        Young colonial officers, many of them now retired diplomats dismayed by Yemen's re-branding as the root of all al-Qaeda evil, spent the happiest and sweatiest years of their lives hurtling around the rocky wildernesses in Land Rovers wearing native head-cloths and Yemeni sarongs, and sometimes chewing qat with the natives. They usually shared the tribesmen's sense of humour and admired their courtesy while bemoaning their prickliness, greed and mulish resistance to change.
        
        Those colonial officers did manage to bring a measure of order to the EAP, an area more properly known as Hadhramaut, which today is familiar to counter-terrorism officers as Osama bin Laden's "ancestral homeland". Mohammed bin Laden left to seek his fortune in Saudi Arabia a few years too early to enjoy the benefits of a tribal truce brokered by a colonial official, Harold Ingrams.
        
        No such "progress" was achieved in the WAP. Aden was so in thrall to the charms of the WAP tribes that when the strident Arab nationalism and anti-imperialism of the Egyptian President, Abdul Gamal Nasser, roused Aden Colony and the protectorates to demand independence, the British fatally overestimated the power of the WAP's tribal sultans to keep their tribes in line and on Britain's side.
        
        The young British diplomat then, Oliver Miles, has recalled how helplessly ignorant the British in Aden felt when the time came to negotiate the handover of power to Marxist leaders of the National Liberation Front, who had ousted the more moderate Arab nationalists by the autumn of 1967: "Who were they? How did they do it? How was it that when we eventually sat down with them for our hasty handover negotiations in Geneva, we recognised more than one face we had known in the Federal Army or the armed police, people of whose true purpose we had known nothing?" Yemen - south and north - retains that unnerving ability to wrongfoot outsiders and avoid conforming to Western narratives. As all the country's foreign occupiers - the British, the Ottomans, the Egyptians and the Russians - discovered, the tribes are motivated by mercenary considerations, not by ideology or religion. In the long term, then, al-Qaeda-inspired jihadism is unlikely to strike firmer roots in Yemen than any other kind of "ism" (except tribalism), unless its promoters' pockets are, literally, bottomless. Yemenis' traditional resistance to outside interference suggests their land would not lend itself to hosting the headquarters of a new Islamist caliphate.
        
        Estimating how active a support base al-Qaeda in the Arabian peninsula has among Yemen's tribes is hard. Yemeni culture is geared to young men acquiring guns at about 15 and desperately seeking a living abroad, sometimes on foreign battlefields. It is harder still to take the Government's estimate of 300 al-Qaeda operatives at face value when large areas are out of its control.
        
        There is a lot of affection for Britain in the south and east of the country - doubtless a measure of how miserably people have fared since 1967. But it may well be that Yemen's ills are too chronic for Britain or even the wider West to tackle with sticking plasters of defence and development aid. Britain lost the propaganda war in the country when we invaded Iraq, and now our ally, Yemen's military tribesman President, Ali Abdullah Saleh, is losing his grip. Yesterday he tried to strike another of his deals with al-Qaeda over laying down arms. With the state failing, there is no one we can safely do business with.
        
        In the short term, the best preparation for the London conference may be to apply pressure to Yemen's wealthy Arab neighbours who have at least as much reason as we do to fear the disintegration of the country. A relaxation of restrictions on Yemeni visas to the Gulf countries, for example, might release some of the steam mounting in the Yemeni pressure cooker. It would not be much, but it would be safer and more useful than funnelling funds to President Saleh.
        
        Victoria Clark's book Yemen: Dancing on the Heads of Snakes will be published by Yale in March

    textlede: Rehab failures put closure of Guantanamo at risk; Al-Qaeda As many as one in five former detainees return to terror after their release, writes Christina Lamb in Washington
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        A NEW report questioning the effectiveness of rehabilitation programmes for former terrorists is threatening to undermine President Barack Obama's pledge to close the Guantanamo Bay detention centre.
        
        The president has already suspended a planned release of Yemeni prisoners because of the attempted Christmas Day airline bombing masterminded from Yemen. The administration has conceded it will not meet its original January 22 deadline for closing the base in Cuba.
        
        The fate of all 198 prisoners still at Guantanamo now hangs in the balance after US figures showed that as many as one in five former detainees have engaged in terrorist activity after their release.
        
        The main hope had been a much vaunted rehabilitation programme set up by Saudi Arabia in 2003. This uses crayon therapy, table tennis and video games to try to turn jihadists away from terrorism.
        
        The Saudis had claimed neartotal success for the programme, which saw 108 former Guantanamo detainees pass through. But 11 of these graduates have been named on the kingdom's list of 85 "most wanted" terrorists. They include Said Ali al-Shihri, who re-emerged as a leader of Al-Qaeda in Yemen, the group claiming responsibility for the Christmas Day bombing plot.
        
        A team of FBI officers and terrorism experts who have visited the rehabilitation centres over the past year to prepare a report for the Department of Homeland Security concluded there were serious doubts about the safety of releasing these people.
        
        "The Saudis claim 80-90% success in turning these jihadists," said John Horgan, director of the International Center for the Study of Terrorism at Pennsylvania State University, who was among the experts.
        
        "But when I asked Saudi officers how they knew these people were safe to release, all they could say was they got a feeling."
        
        Run by Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the programme initially received international plaudits. Aside from art therapy, games and religious discussion to counter radicalisation, it also relies on social support. Jihadists are encouraged to get a flat, find a wife and settle down.
        
        "It's more like a halfway house than a prison," explained Christopher Boucek, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who visited the camps.
        
        "The centres have guards and fences and you can't leave when you want to, but the first thing that happens to prisoners is their shackles are removed."
        
        He warned: "I think what we have seen is, it is unrealistic to close Gitmo if you don't have a programme to monitor people when released."
        
        Horgan agrees. Although he praised the Saudi scheme for being "innovative and ambitious", he said: "The idea that this is a silver bullet is naive. These guys are not being deradicalised. They are being encouraged to disassociate from terrorism, but their fundamental views have not changed."
        
        The unpublished homeland security report's main criticism is the lack of any reliable risk assessment to decide whether an individual should be allowed back into society.
        
        "Sex offenders have to meet all sorts of criteria before they are released," Horgan said.
        
        "Why shouldn't it be the same for terrorists?"
        
        The report points out that there is currently no way of measuring recidivism.
        
        "Al-Qaeda and the terror network aren't usually broadcasting when the terrorists go back, so you find out someone is a recidivist only when they are captured or unusually visible," said Thomas Joscelyn, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defence of Democracies, a policy institute.
        
        "Empirically, we now know if the Saudis did have some measures, they failed."
        
        Many of the Saudi rehab graduates ended up in Yemen. Apart from Shihri, these included Ibrahim Suleiman al-Rubaish, Al-Qaeda's spiritual leader in the Arabian peninsula, and Abu Hareth Muhammad al-Awfi, who appeared in an Al-Qaeda video last January, threatening attacks. Shihri is thought to have played a direct role in an Al-Qaeda attack on the American embassy in Sana'a, the Yemeni capital, in 2008, in which 19 people died.
        
        Obama admitted last week that this group had worked with Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian accused of trying to blow up an airliner bound for Detroit.
        
        "They sought to strike not only American targets in Yemen but the United States itself," he said.
        
        The president's admission has strengthened resistance from his Republican opponents to closing Guantanamo. Senator Jeff Sessions, the top Republican on the judiciary committee, wrote to the US attorney-general last month, calling the Saudi programme a failure and demanding that the US suspend the release of detainees to it.
        
        "The list of failed participants in the Saudi programme reads like a who's who of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian peninsula," he said.
        
        "A serious nation can't simply release from custody terrorists determined to destroy us into the streets," he added.
        
        "The US has taken grave risks in releasing a number of these prisoners, and flight 253 to Detroit was a rendezvous with reality."
        
        It is not only Saudis and Yemenis who have returned to their old ways. US officials say that of 530 detainees released from Guantanamo, 20% have rejoined terrorist efforts.
        
        They include Mullah Abdullah Zakir, the Taliban commander in Helmand; Abdullah Mahsud, who directed a suicide attack in Afghanistan that killed 31 before killing himself to avoid capture; Abdullah Saleh Ali al-Ajmi who was repatriated to Kuwait, then blew himself up in Mosul, Iraq, killing 13.
        
        Obama has insisted the Christmas plot will not deflect him from closing the detention facility.
        
        "Make no mistake, we will close Guantanamo prison, which has damaged our national security interests and become a tremendous recruiting tool for Al-Qaeda," he said.
        
        Of the remaining 198 prisoners in Guantanamo, however, 90 are from Yemen and the US has suspended the repatriation of Yemeni prisoners. Officials fear they could rejoin militant groups.
        
        Last month the administration announced that it intends to acquire the Thomson correctional centre, a largely vacant state prison in Illinois, to house about 100 detainees.

    textlede: From bikinis to burkas: A Yemeni memoir; In his childhood, Toronto writer Kamal Al-Solaylee recalls a cosmopolitan, secular family from southern Yemen. Today his sisters and brothers are close-minded Islamists. As one middle-class clan loses its own struggle with extremism, so goes the country
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Shopping for bikinis with my four sisters in the summer of 1975 brought out the fashion beast in me, an 11-year-old living in exile with his family in Egypt.
        
        "The colour on this brown two-piece makes you look darker," I tell my sister Raja. She picks a lime-green bikini instead.
        
        "I love this one so much, I want to wear it myself," I blurt out to Ferial, clinching her choice of a black-and-white striped swimsuit.
        
        The fruit of that shopping trip hangs on the office wall of my Toronto apartment - a photograph taken a few days later of myself, my four sisters and three brothers on a beach in Alexandria.
        
        The photo captures a moment of bourgeois life in the Middle East, before the region became associated in the Western collective psyche with exporting terror or the subjugation of women. It's an image of a large and admittedly privileged family, led by enlightened, secular parents from southern Yemen.
        
        Yes, the same Yemen that, since Christmas Day, has been reintroduced to the world as a second Afghanistan or the third front in the war on terror - where my family still lives, in the capital, Sanaa. But the Yemen of today is nothing like the one where my older siblings came of age in the 1950s and 1960s. And when I speak to my family now, they have changed so much that it's hard to believe we are even related.
        
        Yemen's new notoriety doesn't surprise me; what does is how all the warning signs went unnoticed for so long. I saw it in my own flesh and blood: An open-minded family defined by its love of arts and culture embraced hard-line interpretations of Islam and turned its back on social progress and intellectual freedom.
        
        Whatever happens next in Yemen, my family there, and no doubt millions of other middle-class Middle Eastern families, has been losing the war against extremism.

There in 1945 my father, Mohamed, then 19, wed the 14-year-old Safia, a shepherdess from Hadramut, a part of Yemen now known as the birthplace of the bin Laden family. With his high-school education and some support from my grandparents, my father started a small real-estate business in what we would call flipping today: He would buy old buildings, renovate and sell them at a profit, as well as renting some units to the British expatriates who "managed" Aden as a colony.
        
        His properties multiplied in number almost as fast as his progeny, 11 in all, born from 1946 to 1964 - the Yemeni version of the boomer generation. The youngest is me.
        
        Today, Aden is home to a growing, violent southern secession movement, and the place where al-Qaeda hit the USS Cole with explosives in 2000 while it was in the harbour. But, according to my family, it was once a model of peace and harmony.
        
        "The Brits brought order," my father used to tell us. My sister Faiza talks of a cosmopolitan port where European ships would stop on the way from Europe to the Indian subcontinent, often bringing with them such coveted merchandise as the latest fashions or, more thrillingly for my then-teenage sisters and brother, early Beatles albums. For some reason, Yemenis especially liked Ringo Starr.
        
        But that security was rocked by guerrilla uprisings in the mid-1960s, and came to an end in the fall of 1967 when the nascent nationalist movement declared independence from the British.
        
        That November, rebels kidnapped my father for two days and released him for a large sum of money, under one condition: We were to pack and leave Aden in 24 hours. Imagine having to find a new home for a family of 11 children in less than a day. Decades later, my sisters would still ask an aunt if she ever found the Beatles records my mother made them leave behind.
        
        What followed were 15 years of exile between Beirut and Cairo. By the late 1970s, though, neither of those tension-filled cities felt safe or welcoming any more, and my father decided there was no choice but to return to Yemen - not to socialist Aden, but to pro-business Sanaa in the north, which was slowly making contact with the outside world after decades of insular, caste-based pseudo-monarchy.
        
        Sanaa? That medieval-looking city? As a young gay man still exploring his sexuality, I knew I couldn't spend the rest of my life in a place where hangings were still held in broad daylight as part of sharia law. But I had to go along, and lived there from 1983 to 1985.
        
        It was a jolt to the system: The streets came to a standstill at 9 p.m. - no one went out, and vans carrying uniformed security guards roamed the city as added security. It was too much silence for a teenager used to the bustle of Cairo.
        
        My sisters' adjustment was more complex. Women were now expected to cover their heads and wear the burka in public, and walk a few steps behind their husbands, fathers or brothers. When I was reunited with my cousin Yousra, who had been living in Sanaa for more than a decade, I reached out to give her a hug, but she pushed me away and shook my hand instead, within the bounds of propriety.
        
        In 1985, I left to study in England, and later migrated to Canada, returning periodically to Sanaa for visits that became more distressing as the years passed, as the gap narrowed between my family and Yemen but widened between them and me.
        
        Of migrants and militants:
        
        The Saddam Hussein factorLocal events didn't help. One of the turning points in Yemen's recent history came in 1990, shortly after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August. Yemen stood out for its support of Saddam Hussein's invasion, and paid a dear price.
        
        As hundreds of thousands of migrant Yemeni workers in Saudi Arabia and neighbouring Gulf countries were expelled in retaliation, many of them settled in Sanaa. A small capital city in an impoverished country, already ill equipped to serve its citizens, it cracked under the pressure.
        
        Streets teemed with the unemployed, particularly young men, many of whom succumbed to the Wahabi brand of Islam that the exiled workers had picked up in Saudi Arabia and brought back.
        
        At the co-ed Sanaa University, female students began to complain about harassment from repatriated Yemenis who blamed women's education for the fast-rising unemployment. I don't recall seeing a single beggar in Sanaa during the early 1980s. Now, they stood at virtually every street corner. That medieval but safe city was now gritty - and still medieval.
        
        I paid a visit to my family in the spring of 1992, my first in almost six years, and was shocked to see how just a few years changed us both so dramatically. There was a defeatist quality to their lives, while mine had hopes of a better future. My sisters seemed especially dispirited. Four of them worked for a living, but although their jobs gave them some economic independence, their lives remained limited. Beyond their commute to work, they rarely ventured anywhere other than grocery or clothing stores.
        
        Returning again in the summer of 2001 - my first visit since I had moved to Canada in 1996 - I encountered a family that was a lot closer to the stereotype of regressive Muslim culture than I had ever known.
        
        The veils were in full view. Everybody prayed five times a day. My brothers were unapologetically sexist in their dealings with their wives. Was this the same family that once took turns reading the great works of literature and subscribed to four newspapers daily, three in Arabic and one in English?
        
        One of my brothers was actually suggesting that his eldest daughter need not go to university because education wouldn't help her much as a housewife. One of my sisters, who is in the 1975 beach photo, now works as a librarian at Sanaa University and wears the full niqab, covering her whole face except, just about, the eyes. One day, she followed me around town for half an hour, just for fun, to see if I would recognize her. I never did.
        
        Collectively they have become television addicts. Satellite TV, featuring hundreds of channels from the Arab world and beyond, has taken over from reading and socializing as the main form of entertainment. Why? Because among the many channels you can watch are the more Islamist ones (Hezbollah's Manar TV, for example) that promote a rigid version of the faith.
        
        By the time I visited Sanaa again in 2006, anti-Western and pro-Islamist sympathies intruded on virtually every conversation with friends, neighbours and family. The presence of al-Qaeda is never spoken of as positive, but it's not challenged or condemned either.
        
        The real danger is the tacit acceptance - an acceptance that has been building slowly for more than two decades and has claimed even progressive families like mine.
        
        The government of President Ali Abdullah Saleh, in power for more than 30 years now, is too busy protecting its own interests from Yemen's relatively small oil wealth - businesses contributing to it include some Alberta oil companies - to show any real interest in the well-being of its middle-class citizens.
        
        Under his watch, Yemen has gone from a poor country to the most destitute in the Arab world. He fortified his stronghold on the country's larger cities in the north (Sanaa, Taiz, Houdeida), but lost control of the vast tribal terrains outside them. The result is a political culture where the cities are riddled with government red tape, while everywhere else is virtually lawless.
        
        Comparisons to Afghanistan are not entirely warmongering on the part of the U.S. media. My family is reasonably well connected, so it keeps surviving one crisis - food and water shortages, health scares - after another. But for how much longer?
        
        Coming down
        
        to a photo finish
        
        In a black photo album tucked inside an old filing cabinet, I keep more recent family photographs, from my visits to Sanaa, or ones they send in the mail. I don't believe that even my closest friends have seen them. The rare times I look at them, I see only a family that has betrayed its secular, intellectual history and has either chosen or been forced to accept intolerance instead.
        
        One photograph from April, 2006, particularly infuriates me. My family's penchant for group photos never wavers, but this time my eldest brother voices his concern about my sisters being photographed in their "indoor" clothes.
        
        "What if the men who work at the photo-developing shop get to see your sisters in short sleeves or without a head scarf?" he asks, as if it's something I should have thought about myself. This is the same brother who is standing behind me in that 1975 picture I love so much.
        
        My sisters immediately see his point. I'm stunned. We reach a compromise. I can pose with my sisters and mother if they wear the hijab, or at least long sleeves and skirts. I fake a smile as my heart breaks. The last thing I want is an argument on my last night in Sanaa.
        
        I haven't seen my family since.

    textlede: 'Head office has gone missing'; While Barack Obama promises a war on terror, the enemy has grown ever more elusive. Michael Valpy tracks the new, scattered web of al-Qaeda
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        In December, 2001, Richard Reid - also known as Abdul Raheem - paid cash for a one-way airfare from Paris to Miami. He boarded American Airlines Flight 63 with the explosive PETN in his shoe, which he tried unsuccessfully to ignite until being subdued by fellow passengers.
        
        That was then. Here is now: In December, 2009, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab paid cash for a one-way airfare from Amsterdam to Detroit. He boarded Northwestern Airline Flight 253 with PETN sewn into his underpants, which he tried to ignite. Until he was subdued by fellow passengers.
        
        What that says about the dreaded global terrorist organization al-Qaeda - which has claimed responsibility for the actions of both men - is a great deal.
        
        It says there appears to be no learning curve. No brains in the executive suite calling the plays. No intelligence atop al-Qaeda's hierarchy comparable to the luminous planning behind the events of Sept. 11, 2001, or the well-orchestrated East Africa bombings in 1998. Indeed, many experts who've studied al-Qaeda believe that the whole metaphor of head office and branch plants is wrong.
        
        "Head office has gone missing," says Janice Stein, director of University of Toronto's Munk Centre for International Studies.
        
        And, paradoxically, that may speak to an even more dangerous foe confronted by U.S. President Barack Obama this week with his words of war: Instead of an enemy whose behaviours were relatively familiar, there are now a multitude of unpredictable and even unknown al-Qaedas.
        
        The image of the organization that's been emblazoned in the media since 9/11 was that of a bureaucratically multilayered organization run by fiat by Osama bin Laden and his clever, highly educated, tactical and theological privy council headquartered in the mountainous badlands between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
        
        It had its iron fingers of control on everything. It had a penchant for paperwork, budgets and titles. It had a shura, a war council. It had a finance committee, a religious committee, even a human-resources committee that monitored who was where in the hierarchy and the state of well-being and engagement of recruits.
        
        Its word was law, and its singular voice of command spoke from every corner of its domain. And as far as anyone on the outside knew, that is how al-Qaeda worked.
        
        In fact, information about it has been thin since its founding by Mr. bin Laden and a dozen or so others in 1988 - a fact readily acknowledged by scholars. University of Toronto's Wesley Wark, a specialist in security issues, describes its operational dynamics as "mysteries."
        
        Today - especially with the rise of a powerful faction in Yemen, making the country a sort of third global front after Pakistan-Afghanistan and Iraq in the war against al-Qaeda - its structure is the subject of heated debate.
        
        Most, although not all, terrorism experts believe that there is now no al-Qaeda "central," the pre-9/11 organization. The bin Laden cadre has been isolated militarily and many of its original leaders have been killed or captured.
        
        What has replaced the pre-9/11 structure is an al-Qaeda brand, a spreading syndicate of autonomous al-Qaeda franchises and affiliates and a stunningly powerful media unit (as-Sahab, "The Clouds") creating high-quality documentary films, iPod files, cellphone videos and websites - a six-fold production output since 2005, all of it aimed at radicalizing young Muslims.
        
        The autonomous franchises and affiliates can be found in Iraq (al-Qaeda in Mesopotamia), Yemen and Saudi Arabia (al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula), North Africa (al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb), Somalia (the affiliated al-Shabaab), Indonesia (Jemaah Islamiyah), Sudan, Egypt, Turkey and South Asia as well as Pakistan-Afghanistan and elsewhere.
        
        They are not linked by shura - or by anything else operationally. In a world of cellphones, satellite phones, e-mail and Skype, all of which can be monitored by high-tech snoopers, communication between Mr. bin Laden's inner circle and the rest of al-Qaeda - when it takes place - is mainly reliant on couriers, a means as old as humanity's two legs.
        
        Mokhtar Lamani, a research fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation in Waterloo, Ont., and a former Moroccan diplomat and senior officer with the League of Arab States, says that as far as anyone knows, franchise operational decisions are completely local, exemplified by the Yemini assignment handed out to Mr. Abdulmutallab.
        
        There is no hint of prior consultation with the bin Laden circle or the other dominions. In the Abdulmutallab case, the nature of the operation was the main tie-in to the al-Qaeda brand: an attack against the "Far Enemy," the United States, and a readiness to incur mass casualties, by blowing up an airliner.
        
        Yet at the same time, operational techniques vary.
        
        If you're kidnapped by al-Qaeda in Iraq, said Mr. Lamani, the likelihood is you'll be killed without even a claim of responsibility being made for your death. If you're kidnapped by al-Qaeda in the Maghreb - like Canadian diplomats Robert Fowler and Louis Guay - the likelihood is greater that your release will be negotiated for a ransom.
        
        Why? It may be because the cultures are different, possibly because al-Qaeda in the Maghreb - or, more accurately, its predecessor, the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat - was founded in 1998 by Hassan Hattab, a former Armed Islamic Group regional commander who broke with the group in 1998 in protest against its slaughter of civilians. In contrast, al-Qaeda in Iraq has been notorious for ruthless tactics since the onset of its presence in the Iraqi insurgency.
        
        But whereas the operational reach and effectiveness of al-Qaeda in Iraq and Pakistan is currently seen as limited, the operational capability of al-Qaeda in the Maghreb is "scary," says Prof. Max Taylor, director of the Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence at Scotland's St. Andrew's University.
        
        It can do long-range reconnaissance and logistics and move around at ease, and plan an operation in Morocco that can be executed in Mali. No other al-Qaeda franchise has that capability. No one for sure knows why. No one for certain knows how numerically strong it is. It could be like al-Qaeda in Yemen - "which has either 50 or hundreds of members," said Prof. Taylor.
        
        Over and over, that same answer comes up: No one knows.
        
        For now, says the University of Toronto's Prof. Wark, the ideological bonds that bind al-Qaeda are tight - a cohesiveness wrought by a consistent fundamentalist ideology: the objective of re-establishing the Islamist caliphate as the religious and political authority over all the peoples of the Muslim world and purifying it from Western, mainly American, contamination.
        
        But that's hardly a complex theology needing centralized doctrinal control comparable, say, to Roman Catholicism's muscular Vatican vigilance. It's simple religious fundamentalism for simple folk.
        
        By far the most significant bond, the essential glue that's made al-Qaeda the world's first global transnational terrorist organization, is the work of as-Sahab and the use of the Internet and other media for propaganda, proselytizing, for spreading the inspirational words and images of Osama bin Laden.
        
        It is why fear of al-Qaeda remains, despite the demise of any clean, recognizable structure of hierarchy, such as that which characterized the Irish Republican Army. What's replaced it is dark anarchy without identity or borders.
        
        It's those incredibly sophisticated media vehicles - Internet-posted or couriered out of Pakistan's wild country - that entice a seemingly endless stream of global wannabe jihadists into making a compact with violence. It is why the Americans keep hunting for Mr. bin Laden even though his hands no longer appear on the levers of operational power.
        
        His idol power on the Internet and on television, his ability to ignite so-called homegrown radicalization, makes him a continuing threat.
        
        It's a virtual seduction of young minds that scholars understand only imperfectly, says Dr. Taylor - a complex menu of ideology, religion, hero-worship and the serpentine attraction of the forbidden and appealing. Dr. Taylor, a psychologist, suggests the dynamic has parallels to images of child sexual abuse on the Internet: dangerous, doubtful, taboo and therefore enticing.
        
        It is this threat that President Obama has declared war on - and it is this threat, says Dr. Taylor, that social scientists have far too little knowledge about how to combat.

        Many faces of al-Qaeda
        
        Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula
        
        Formed in January, 2009, by a merger between al-Qaeda in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, it's now based in eastern Yemen. It aims to topple the Saudi monarchy and Yemeni government. Prominent attacks include the Riyadh bombings in 2003 and a 2008 attack on the U.S embassy in Yemen.
        
        Al-Qaeda in the
        
        Islamic Maghreb
        
        Based in Algeria, it emerged in early 2007 and is notorious for bombing government targets and kidnapping Westerners (including Canadians Robert Fowler and Louis Guay).
        
        Harakat al-Shabaab Mujahideen
        
        Spread across pockets of Somalia, its members enforce harsh interpretation of Islamic law in areas of their control. Most of their attacks are aimed at warlords, African Union peacekeepers and Somali government soldiers.
        
        Al-Qaeda in Iraq
        
        Aiming to push foreign troops out of Iraq and replace the U.S.-backed Iraqi government with Islamic rule, the Iraqi arm of al-Qaeda comprises various extremist groups that opposed the American invasion.
        
        Jemaah Islamiyah
        
        The Indonesian-based arm of al-Qaeda, its most notorious strike was the Bali nightclub bombings of 2002. With links to militants in Malaysia and the Philippines, it aims to bring Islamic rule to a broad swath of Asia.

    textlede: Cash-strapped Yemen finds a reason to join the hunt for al-Qaeda
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Abdul Majeed Zandani, a strident Sunni cleric, spoke for many Yemenis when he told his Sanaa congregation that the attempt to blow up an American airliner was part of a dire conspiracy to justify the U.S. occupation of Yemen.
        
        "Lah! Lah! Lah!" (No! No! No!) The worshippers shouted as they rose to their feet in fury at the deviousness of the Americans.
        
        While fears have been stoked across this impoverished land about the intense and sudden scrutiny of Washington, some see the growing threat of al-Qaeda - and the U.S. response to it - as a golden opportunity for embattled President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
        
        "I think he's the big winner," a prominent Yemeni businessman said.
        
        "The country stands to get a big influx of money, and he'll get all the credit."
        
        Already last week, U.S. President Barack Obama asked Congress for $150-million in military aid to Yemen this year, up from $10-million in 2009.
        
        "And now," a member of the country's Shura Council said, "al-Qaeda is our top priority."
        
        What a turnaround.
        
        Until Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab attempted to blow up Northwest Airlines Flight 253 on Christmas Day, al-Qaeda was barely a blip on Yemen's radar.
        
        Sure, the country of 23 million had rallied to the American cause in 2000 when al-Qaeda rammed a suicide boat into the destroyer USS Cole in the Yemeni port of Aden, killing 17 U.S. sailors. For a few years Sanaa carried out arrests at Washington's behest, and even stayed silent when a U.S. drone took out al-Qaeda's Yemeni leader in 2002.
        
        Recently, however, Yemen has had its hands full with its own problems: an on-again off-again rebellion in the North, an increasingly violent separatist campaign in the South - not to mention a withering economy. As a result, al-Qaeda in Yemen was allowed to grow, much to the consternation of the United States.
        
        All of which leads many people, U.S. and British officials included, to wonder: Can Yemen cope on its own with the growing al-Qaeda menace?
        
        After all, Yemen hasn't done particularly well in dealing with its strictly domestic difficulties.
        
        In the northern province of Saada, a Shia group that once ruled North Yemen has been trying for six years to make a comeback. By some accounts, the Houthis, who are enduring some of the country's worst poverty, feel slighted by the Saleh administration. Others say the group is fighting for its spiritual survival in the face of growing Sunni religiosity in the rest of Yemen.
        
        Either way, the threat to Mr. Saleh's administration was such that neighbouring Saudi Arabia took it upon itself to bomb Houthi villages in support of the Yemeni President.
        
        Even in the southern province of Abyan, where the separatists are loud and violent though small in number, the government has seemed powerless to end the campaign.
        
        It was because of the chaos that stemmed from these two struggles that al-Qaeda has prospered in Yemen.
        
        "Al-Qaeda took advantage," Foreign Minister Abu Bakr al-Qirbi said yesterday. The result, he said, is the presence of "about 200 to 300 al-Qaeda operatives" on Yemeni soil - a very conservative estimate by most accounts.
        
        To this must be added the fact that the government is unable to operate effectively throughout the rest of Yemen. ("Parts of the country are undergoverned," said a U.S. official with an apparent gift for euphemism yesterday.) All of which leads some in Washington to start talking of Yemen as a fragile, if not already failed, state, and of the prospect of al-Qaeda seizing control in Yemen just as the Taliban did in Afghanistan.
        
        Gregory Johnsen, a former Fulbright Fellow in Yemen, thinks that is unlikely.
        
        "The idea that al-Qaeda presents some sort of direct challenge to the Yemeni government to rule the state is incredibly overblown," he said. Just because al-Qaeda is stronger than it has been in the past, he believes, "doesn't mean that it's strong enough to challenge the state."
        
        Yemeni security officials confidently apply the same analysis even to the country's undergoverned areas, where Yemen's deputy interior minister is said to have met in the past few days with the tribal sheiks who rule much of the country beyond Sanaa.
        
        "They don't want al-Qaeda to succeed either," said a member of the advisory Shura Council who is familiar with the situation.
        
        "And they'll make sure it doesn't."
        
        While the United States and others in the West fault Yemen's government for failing to apprehend the growing threat of terror in its midst, Yemen says the West didn't pay much attention to its needs either.
        
        "The West sees terrorism as the big issue," a former cabinet minister said.
        
        "To us, it's the economy."
        
        Yemen's oil reserves are dwindling, water and electricity are in short supply, about 40 per cent of the work force is unemployed, and the population is growing rapidly.
        
        "If you really want to fight al-Qaeda," the former minister said, "help our workers return to their jobs in the Gulf countries."
        
        Since 1991, when Yemen sided with Saddam Hussein even after he invaded Kuwait, the countries of the Persian Gulf have refused to rehire the two million Yemeni workers they kicked out.
        
        "Get Yemenis two million jobs in the Gulf," the former minister said, "and it will solve our economic problems and cut off al-Qaeda's supply of recruits at the same time."

        A HISTORY OF AL-QAEDA ACTIVITY IN YEMEN
        
        Civil war and lawlessness have turned Yemen into an alternative base for al-Qaeda, which U.S. officials say has been largely pushed out of Afghanistan and is under military pressure from Pakistan. Between 200 and 300 al-Qaeda fighters are believed to be operating in Yemen, including foreign veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Following is a timeline tracing al-Qaeda activity in Yemen since 2000.
        
        Oct. 12, 2000 The bombing of the destroyer USS Cole in Aden harbour kills 17 sailors and blows a hole in the ship's hull.
        
        Oct. 6, 2002 An explosion damages the French supertanker Limburg in the Gulf of Aden in an attack for which five al-Qaeda-linked Yemenis are later convicted.
        
        PUBDAT:	July 2, 2007 Seven Spanish tourists are killed when a car bomb hits their convoy in the eastern province of Marib.
        
        Jan. 18, 2008 Gunmen fire on a tourist group in Hadramaut, killing two Belgian women and their two Yemeni drivers.
        
        Sept. 17, 2008 Two suicide car bombers attack the heavily fortified U.S. embassy complex in Sanaa, killing 16 people. Washington says the attack bears "all the hallmarks" of al-Qaeda.
        
        PUBDAT:	January, 2009 Al-Qaeda's Yemeni and Saudi wings announce they have merged into a new group called al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula led by Nasser al-Wahayshi, former Yemeni aide to Osama bin Laden.
        
        PUBDAT:	June, 2009 The bodies of three kidnapped foreign women - two Germans and a South Korean - are found in the northern province of Saada. Six other foreigners remain missing. No group claims responsibility, though AQAP is suspected.
        
        Aug. 27, 2009 Abdullah al-Asiri, an al-Qaeda suicide bomber posing as a repentant militant, is flown from Yemen to Saudi Arabia, where he tries to kill the kingdom's anti-terrorism chief, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, in the first such attack on a Saudi royal.
        
        Nov. 3, 2009 Al-Qaeda claims the killing of seven Yemeni security officials in an ambush near the Saudi border.
        
        Dec. 24, 2009 Yemen says 30 al-Qaeda militants are killed in air strikes in the eastern province of Shabwa. A security official says Mr. Wahayshi, his Saudi deputy, Saeed al-Shehri, and U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki are among the dead. There is no confirmation.
        
        Dec. 28, 2009 AQAP claims responsibility for the failed bombing of a Detroit-bound U.S. airliner on Christmas Day.
        
        Jan. 1, 2010 Sheik Mukhtar Robow Abuu Mansuur, a leader of the Somali Islamist militia al-Shabaab, says his group is ready to send reinforcements to AQAP should the United States attack its bases in Yemen.
        
        Jan. 5, 2010 U.S. President Barack Obama suspends the transfer of prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay to Yemen after revelations that former detainees have joined AQAP. Of the 198 prisoners still held at Guantanamo, about 90 are Yemeni. Among the senior leadership of AQAP are two Saudi militants released from Guantanamo several years ago.
        
        Jan. 27, 2010 An international conference being convened by Britain with the United States and other nations will explore ways of fighting al-Qaeda in Yemen.

    textlede: Divisions create breeding ground for terrorism
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Experts say al-Qaeda is set to exploit divisision between the North and south of Yemen to attract recruits, writes SUDARSAN RAGHAVANin Aden, Yemen
        
        A HATRED of the government in southern Yemen is complicating US-backed efforts to stem al-Qaeda s ambitions across the region, according to western and Yemeni officials, analysts and human rights activists.
        
        The concerns highlight the extent to which the United States, as it deepens its military engagement here, is teaming up with a government facing internal divisions that in some ways are more complex than those in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.
        
        In a speech on Thursday, US president Barack Obama said his country has worked closely with its partners, including Yemen, to inflict major blows against al-Qaeda. But experts familiar with the group here say it is poised to exploit the country s divisions to attract recruits and more sympathy from the south s powerful tribes.
        
        Al-Qaeda dreams of secession, said Najib Ghallab, a political science professor at Sanaa University.
        
        It wants to turn the south into the perfect breeding ground for global terrorism.
        
        Once two countries, Yemen was unified in 1990. But a brief civil war broke out in 1994. From the north, President Ali Abdullah Saleh dispatched thousands of Yemeni mujahideen who had fought in Afghanistan as well as Salafists, who follow a strict interpretation of Islam, to fight the southerners.
        
        Ever since, tension has gripped the region. The government s resources are stretched thin, as it also grapples with a Shia rebellion in the north.
        
        Southerners contend that the government has denied them their share of oil revenue, and has dismissed many southerners from military and government jobs.
        
        A wave of protests has roiled the south, prompting a government crackdown. Many members of the Southern Movement, a loosely knit coalition, now demand secession.
        
        We no longer want our rights from the government. We want a separate north and south, said Ahmed Kassim, a secessionist leader who spoke in a hushed tone inside a car on a recent day in the southern port city of Aden.
        
        In May, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the affiliate alleged to have masterminded the attempted bombing of an American jet on Christmas Day, declared its support for the southerners demands for a separate state.
        
        The group s leader, Nasser al-Wahayshi, promised to avenge the oppression faced by southerners.
        
        Southern Yemen, nestled at the tip of the Arabian Peninsula, edges the strategic Bab el-Mandab strait, one of the world s oil shipping choke points. It is also a gateway to Somalia, where the Islamist militant movement al-Shabab, which has ties to al-Qaeda, is fighting the US-backed Somali transitional government.
        
        Al-Qaeda militants have thrived in Yemen s southern and southeastern provinces. They are shielded by tribal alliances and codes in religiously conservative communities that do not tolerate outside interference, even from the government. A shared dislike of central authority and US policies in the Middle East has strengthened al-Qaeda s bonds with southern tribesmen.
        
        The resentment persists in Aden, where al-Qaeda militants bombed the USS Colein 2000, killing 17 American sailors.
        
        Inside the dented white car, Kassim sat with another secessionist leader Nasser Atawil. Now and then, they looked nervously out the window, concerned that Yemeni intelligence agents might overhear their conversation with a journalist. They complained that the names of streets had been changed to northern ones.
        
        They said northerners had taken buildings, farms and land from southerners. Northerners, they contended, gain entry into better universities and have better careers.
        
        Atawil, a retired army general, said his pension was half what his northern counterparts receive.
        
        What the government is doing will make al-Qaeda stronger here, he said.
        
        In another corner of Aden, the managing editor of Al Ayyam, the largest and most influential daily in the south, said the government has banned his paper for sympathising with the Southern Movement s cause.
        
        We are virtually under house arrest, Hani Bashraheel said. On Monday, journalists staged a sit-in to protest at the shutdown.
        
        But clashes erupted between police and the paper s armed guards; a policeman and a guard were killed. On Wednesday, police arrested Hani and his father, Hisham Bashraheel, the paper s editor.
        
        According to Human Rights Watch, Yemeni forces opened fire on unarmed protesters six times in 2008 and 2009, killing at least 11 and wounding dozens.
        
        On Thursday, a senior Yemeni official denied the government was using excessive force and instead said some secessionists had targeted government forces.
        
        They claim they are a movement, but they are outlaws, said Rashad al-Alimi, deputy prime minister for security and defence.
        
        With continuing government repression, concern is growing that violence could increase especially as the US-backed war on al-Qaeda unfolds in the south.
        
        Since July, there have been more reports of protesters bringing weapons to rallies, according to Human Rights Watch. In November, al-Qaeda militants killed three senior security officials and four escorts in the southern province of Hadhramaut.
        
        The recent alliance between a powerful tribal leader and former jihadist, Tariq al-Fadhli, and the Southern Movement also has escalated tensions.
        
        Fadhli, who is from the south, fought against the Soviets in Afghanistan. Then Saleh sent him to fight against the former Marxist forces in the south during the civil war. But in April, Fadhli broke ties with Saleh, injecting new momentum into the Southern Movement. Since then, protests against the government have intensified.
        
        The government has accused Fadhli and the Southern Movement of colluding with al-Qaeda. They have denied this and accuse Saleh of using the spectre of al-Qaeda to elicit support from the US and its Middle East allies.
        
        Still, some rights activists say an alliance is forming between some secessionists, Fadhli and al-Qaeda. Christoph Wilcke, a Human Rights Watch researcher for Yemen, said at least one al-Qaeda leader had joined Fadhli and the Southern Movement. He was killed in a US-backed Yemeni airstrike last month, Wilcke said.
        
        Any melding of the Southern Movement and al-Qaeda is far from established, he said. But that could change if the US-backed war deepens without Washington pressuring Saleh to stop repression in the south. Angry southerners, meanwhile, have accused the government and the US of killing a few dozen civilians in an airstrike last month. Yemeni officials say they killed militants and their relatives. It will change the sympathies if they have a common enemy in the United States, Wilcke said.
        
        Al-Qaeda will become more of an ally. This is exactly what we don t want to get into.

    textlede: U.S. Has Limited Resources to Face Threats in Yemen
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        As the Obama administration confronts the latest terrorism threat in Yemen, its diplomatic and development efforts are being constrained by a shortage of resources, a lack of in-house expertise and a fraught history with a Yemeni leader deeply ambivalent about American help.
        
        Administration officials said they focused on Yemen as a hothouse for Islamic terrorism from the day President Obama took office. The United States has tripled its foreign assistance to the country from 2008 levels and plans to spend up to $63 million on Yemen this year.
        
        But by all accounts, that is a modest amount for a country that is suddenly a central threat on the foreign policy landscape; it is roughly the same amount the United States sends to Serbia. It illustrates how much the United States is stretched on the foreign policy front, and how hard it is to extend its resources beyond the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
        
        Beyond providing military and intelligence help -- showcased in recent airstrikes on training sites for Al Qaeda -- the administration has yet to develop a coherent plan for dealing with Yemen's pervasive poverty and corruption, according to former diplomats and outside experts. Those ills, they say, are at the root of Yemen's lure for terrorists.
        
        "I don't think we have a strategy for Yemen; I think we have some responses," said Edmund J. Hull, the American ambassador there from 2001 to 2004.
        
        "It's difficult to do because the problems in Yemen are so huge that you almost get stopped before you start."
        
        In an overburdened State Department, there are only a handful of Yemen experts, compared with 30 people from nine government agencies who are assigned just to the administration's special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard C. Holbrooke.
        
        Washington's limited insight into Yemen was on display Thursday, when the White House's chief counterterrorism adviser, John O. Brennan, expressed surprise that Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was sophisticated enough to carry out a plot against an American jetliner. In fact, Mr. Brennan, a onetime C.I.A. station chief in neighboring Saudi Arabia, is widely regarded as one of the administration's most knowledgeable officials about the country.
        
        "It's not that Yemen is the most mysterious and unknowable country in the world," said Micah Zenko, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
        
        "One needs to ask why more wasn't done sooner."
        
        The State Department said it had decided to step up its engagement with Yemen even before the botched Dec. 25 attack on the jetliner. In September, the United States signed an agreement with the Yemeni government for a three-year $120 million "stabilization program," devised to create jobs and improve health and other public services on an accelerated timetable.
        
        "We wanted to put together a package of quick-impact projects that would give people a sense that their lives are improving," said Janet A. Sanderson, a deputy assistant secretary of state who oversees Yemen.
        
        After the Navy destroyer Cole was bombed in Yemen in 2000, the United States embarked on a similar effort. In addition to focusing on counterterrorism operations, the State Department helped finance projects like a health clinic on the rugged highway between the capital, Sana, and Marib, a town in a remote region where Qaeda forces are known to cluster.
        
        Improving health care is one way to make Yemenis less receptive to Al Qaeda and other extremists, Mr. Hull said. The United States had previously tended to focus its economic aid on politically influential places like Sana and Aden, the port city where the Cole was attacked. From 2002 to 2004, officials said, Qaeda elements in Yemen were on the defensive.
        
        But Washington's relations with Yemen soured after several Qaeda suspects escaped from a prison in Sana in 2006. After the release of a high-profile Qaeda operative in 2007, the United States suspended aid that Yemen was supposed to get through the Millennium Challenge program.
        
        "You had this reversal and downward trend in relations," Mr. Hull said.
        
        "Both we and they took our eyes off the ball."
        
        By 2008, nonmilitary aid to Yemen had dwindled to less than $20 million. Afghanistan is expected to receive $2.7 billion a year in nonmilitary aid, Pakistan $1.5 billion and Iraq $500 million.
        
        The administration doubled Yemen's economic aid last year, but as Barbara K. Bodine, another former ambassador, pointed out, the amount "works out to $1.60 per Yemeni."
        
        "That won't even buy you a cup of coffee in Yemen," she added, "and they invented coffee."
        
        Ms. Bodine, who was posted to Yemen at the time of the Cole bombing, said that even with the increased commitment, American aid was still overly skewed toward military support, much of it covert. Over time, she said, that could undermine Yemen's struggling democracy.
        
        "If they see David Petraeus more than Kathleen Sebelius, then we have a problem," Ms. Bodine said, referring to the military commander and the secretary of health and human services, respectively.
        
        State Department officials acknowledge that the United States has limited resources for Yemen, though given the intense scrutiny focused on the country, those numbers could rise. But they question whether more aid money would be used effectively, given the pervasive corruption there. As it is, the United States steers most of its dollars through outside organizations like CARE.
        
        Officials also say the United States has to be realistic about what can be done in Yemen, given a long list of problems, including a water shortage, dwindling oil reserves and secessionist movements in the south, a major insurgency in the north and a growing young population with no jobs.
        
        In a speech this week on development strategy, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton came close to labeling Yemen a lost cause.
        
        "In countries that are incubators of extremism, like Yemen," she said, "the odds are long. But the cost of doing nothing is potentially far greater."
        
        The biggest hurdle to aid may be Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh. While American officials said he appeared determined to root out Qaeda elements, his resolve has wavered over time, depending on his calculation of whether radical Islamists are a threat or benefit to him. Mr. Saleh is also worried about being too closely identified with the United States.
        
        Saudi Arabia already pours an estimated $1 billion a year into Yemen, and the United Arab Emirates, Britain and Germany have longstanding ties.
        
        "He hasn't always been eager for American support," a senior administration official said of Mr. Saleh.
        
        "That's all the more reason to wrap this in broader international support. That makes it easier politically for him."

    textlede: US Navy concerned about al-Qaeda threats off Africa
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        HIGHLIGHT: The US Navy says it is on heightened alert after receiving what it calls "credible" al-Qaeda threats against American warships and commercial vessels in the Gulf of Aden, the Arabian Sea, and the Persian Gulf.
        
        The latest threat from Osama bin Laden's terror network calls on followers to gather intelligence about ships and their sailors so that they can be targeted for attacks.
        
        The threat, made on December 31 in a message posted on an extremist Internet Web site, prompted the Naval Criminal Investigative Service to elevate the risk for all US military and commercial ships sailing through an area stretching from Somalia to the Persian Gulf.
        
        The message contained detailed instructions, particularly on what type of intelligence should be collected from each US warship. The unnamed author says al-Qaeda will use the information to target American vessels, including aircraft carriers, submarines, and all naval equipment deployed in the region. He urges potential informants not to underestimate the importance of any piece of information they can gather.
        
        Navy spokesperson Lieutenant Nathan Christiansen tells VOA that sailors and their families have been warned to be careful not to reveal any information that could be used against them.
        
        "It is important that Navy families remain vigilant in not sharing potentially sensitive or secure information by any non-secure means, and that includes letters, e-mails, phone conversations, or social media including Facebook," he said.
        
        Fifth Fleet would not comment on what additional security measures are being taken to protect its ships and personnel.
        
        The US Navy has a significant presence in the region, especially in the Gulf of Aden - a busy commercial shipping lane off the northern coast of Somalia. The US Navy and the navies of dozens of other countries are patrolling the narrow waterway to deter ship hijackings-for-ransom by pirate gangs.
        
        Reports that al-Qaeda-trained operatives may be poised to attack American commercial and passenger vessels in the Arabian Sea are being widely circulated in Arab-speaking Gulf states, including Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates. Western intelligence officials have reportedly urged each country to boost security measures and to provide better protection for ships, especially oil and gas tankers.
        
        Yesterday, a Kuwaiti newspaper, al-Qabas, said unnamed Kuwaiti security sources confirmed that al-Qaida has regrouped in the region in recent months, thanks largely to the deteriorating security in Somalia and Yemen.
        
        Both countries are home to militant anti-West insurgent groups that have publicly claimed allegiance to al-Qaeda. The group in Yemen, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, is believed to have ties with Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian man accused of trying to blow up a US passenger jet on December 25.
        
        Al-Qaeda has targeted the US Navy in the past. In 2001, al-Qaeda boasted that it had carried out the October 2000 bombing of USS Cole while the destroyer was refuelling at a port in southern Yemen. The blast killed 17 sailors and wounded 39 others.

    textlede: Obama at war risks outdoing Bush; Battling al-Qaeda, the President could find himself overcompensating for earlier attempts to distance himself from his predecessor
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        In Year 1, with their worst memories still so raw, Americans embraced him as the anti-Bush. Must he become, in Year 2, Son of Bush?
        
        Barack Obama, who banned the very use of the term "war on terror" in his administration, now finds himself forced to prove he can wage it as ruthlessly as the predecessor whose legacy he so sought to undo.
        
        "I've come here to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world," the President said in Cairo in June.
        
        "This cycle of suspicion and discord must end."
        
        It sounded so promising. But the goodwill overtures - the vow to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, the vow to uphold the legal rights of suspected terrorists, the vow to reject profiling - have become a luxury Mr. Obama can no longer afford to extend.
        
        Most Americans, for a time at least, aren't interested in what the rest of the world thinks. And Mr. Obama knows it.
        
        "It's clear he had been stressing the differences between his administration and the previous administration. Now, for obvious reasons, he's beginning to stress the similarities between his approach and the Bush administration's approach," remarked James Lee Ray, a Middle East expert at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.
        
        Perceived as peaceniks, Democratic presidents may be doomed to overcompensate when confronted with threats to U.S. security. That, after all, is how we got the Bay of Pigs, Vietnam and, arguably, a 30,000-troop surge in Afghanistan.
        
        Hence, Mr. Obama's "We are at war" declaration yesterday might have been expected, along with the kind of profiling language that would normally send grassroots Democrats into a fit: "We know that the vast majority of Muslims reject al-Qaeda. But it is clear that al-Qaeda increasingly seeks to recruit individuals without known terrorist affiliations, not just in the Middle East but in Africa and other places, to do their bidding. That's why I've directed my national security team to develop a strategy that addresses the unique challenges posed by lone recruits."
        
        To be sure, there were a couple of olive branches to the Muslim world. But where, not long ago, they were all Mr. Obama talked about, they had been reduced to niceties yesterday.
        
        Any post-9/11 president confronted with the systemic intelligence failure that led to the Christmas Day terrorist attempt onboard a Detroit-bound Northwest Airlines flight would, for reasons pertaining to both style and substance, have had to take corrective action. But because of who he is - or at least, who Americans think he is - Mr. Obama has been under even greater pressure to do so.
        
        He brought it upon himself with his move, on his second day in office, to announce the closing of Guantanamo Bay within a year. The Cuban prison where the United States has detained real and suspected terrorists without regard for U.S. or international law had come to symbolize the worst of George W. Bush's presidency of errors.
        
        Just this week, Mr. Obama reiterated his promise to close Gitmo, insisting it has "become a tremendous recruiting tool for al-Qaeda" and "an explicit rationale for the formation of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula," the Yemen-based faction to which the would-be Christmas Day bomber, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, adhered.
        
        Yet none of Mr. Obama's Year 1 overtures stopped Mr. Abdulmutallab from continuing his journey to the dark side. And as much as closing Gitmo is desirable for a number of reasons, there is little evidence to suggest doing so would lead aspiring terrorists to renounce their ways.
        
        "To say that as long as we have Guantanamo, people will have become more easily radicalized, or that if we close Guantanamo, they will stop being radicalized, is nonsense," insisted Maki Haberfeld, a terrorism expert at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice at the City University of New York.
        
        "That really has nothing to do with why people become radicalized."
        
        For every carrot Mr. Obama waved at the Muslim world, Americans are now demanding he wield an even bigger stick. That was the message of yesterday's speech, where the Gitmo promise was nowhere to be found.
        
        Until yesterday, Mr. Obama had yet to live down his November memorial speech at Fort Hood, the Texas military base where Major Nidal Hasan gunned down 13 active and retired soldiers, in which the President did not once utter the word Muslim. He did not make that mistake yesterday.
        
        Mr. Obama's early eagerness to underscore the differences between his approach to terrorism and that of Mr. Bush has now obliged him to yank the steering wheel in the other direction.
        
        The irony is that, even before the Dec. 25 attempt, there had been a striking continuity between the Obama and Bush administrations in dealing with terrorists and terrorism. Almost all of the worst abuses of the Bush years had been done away with before Mr. Obama took over. Mr. Bush eliminated the use of waterboarding on suspected terrorists and reformed the military commissions before which a few of them faced trial. Mr. Bush also tried some people accused of terrorism in U.S. civil courts. Mr. Obama has promised no more than that. Even Mr. Bush voiced his desire to close Gitmo one day.
        
        It is ironic, too, that someone as nuanced as Mr. Obama actively sought to establish himself as the anti-Bush. In other words, the image he projected of himself was that of a caricature of a caricature.
        
        He risks spending his second year in the Oval Office (over)compensating for that.

        HIGHLIGHT: With instability from a growing al-Qaida presence in the country, Iranian-funded rebels in the north, separatist rebels in the south and a dictatorial regime desperate to face its threats, all the conditions are being created for a perfect Mideast storm. ARAB WORLD. The author is a senior research fellow at the Global Research in International Affairs Center, IDC, Herzliya.
        
        US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton yesterday described the current situation in Yemen as "a threat to regional stability and even to global stability."
        
        She was referring to the fact that Yemen is the latest failed state to become a haven for elements of the Sunni global jihad. Like Afghanistan and Sudan before it, Yemen is becoming a key regional base for al-Qaida.
        
        Unlike in the other two countries, in Yemen this has come about not because of an agreement reached between the jihadis and the authorities; rather, the inability of the Yemeni authorities to impose their rule throughout their country, coupled with the close proximity of Yemen to Saudi Arabia - a key target for al-Qaida - has made the country a tempting prospect for the terrorists.
        
        Al-Qaida is not the only major problem facing Yemen. In fact, it could be argued that the country manages to encapsulate in acute form the three main causes of political turmoil in the Middle East: a dictatorial government, vulnerability to Iranian subversion through local jihadis and the presence and activity of the Sunni global jihad.
        
        Last January, the hitherto little-heard-of Yemeni franchise of al-Qaida merged with the Saudi franchise to form the so-called "al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula" (AQAP). The Saudi jihadis were facing an increasingly effective counterterror campaign by the Saudi authorities, and therefore decided to shift focus to lightly-governed Yemen, where proper security fails to extend much beyond the capital city of San'a.
        
        Through its organizing of the failed attack on Northwest Airlines Flight 253, AQAP has now entered the major leagues of the global jihad. Fears of an imminent second strike led to temporary closure of the US, British and French embassies in San'a over the last week.
        
        YEMEN IS currently host to no less than three separate insurgencies. Each resembles one another in that they are being conducted by forces committed to some form of political Islam. There, however, the similarities end.
        
        Probably the most politically and militarily significant of the three Islamist insurgencies is that of the Houthi rebels in the Saada district in the north. The Zaidi Shi'ite rebels of the al-Houthi clan have been engaged in an insurgency against the Yemeni authorities since 2004. Quelling the uprising has proved quite beyond the capabilities of the government of Ali Abdalla Saleh.
        
        In the past few months, the Shi'ite Houthis have extended their activities across the border to Saudi Arabia. Their close proximity to the Saudi border makes them a useful tool for Iran to pressure Riyadh. Responding to rebel attacks in November, the Saudis struck back with aircraft and helicopter gunships, killing around 40 Houthis. Regardless, Iran is sending regular arms shipments to the Houthis, continuing to stoke the flames of the rebellion. The real possibility of further deterioration remains.
        
        The second insurgency faced by the hapless Yemeni regime is a separatist campaign in the south. Yemen was only reunified in 1990, and has since suffered a brief civil war in 1994. The separatist insurgency, led by Islamist tribal leader Tareq al-Fadhli, again grew in intensity during 2009, with a number of stormy demonstrations and armed confrontations leading to deaths on both sides.
        
        As if fighting insurgencies on two separate fronts was not enough, Yemen is also being hit hard by economic woes. The country's steadily depleting oil reserves are unable to generate sufficient income for the government to maintain the tribal patronage system on which it depends. Gas exports are failing to make up the shortfall. And Yemen's water supplies are also dwindling.
        
        Like a parasite that spots, enters and exploits a weakening body, AQAP has now added its own particular brand of Islamist insurgency to this volatile situation.
        
        The close proximity of Yemen to Saudi Arabia and to international shipping lanes makes the country's instability a factor which the US and the West cannot afford to ignore.
        
        This, however, raises a dilemma. The regime of President Ali Saleh is autocratic, inefficient and largely ineffectual. Its economic policies have failed to develop the country, leaving the regime sitting precariously on top of a boiling cauldron of poverty, illiteracy, extremism and discontent. To remain on its perch, the regime is now asking for ever larger contributions of US funding and assistance to counter the terror.
        
        Since Yemen's government rules in name only in large parts of the country, increasing the US commitment to combating al-Qaida in the country raises the possibility of US ground forces in Yemen. President Barack Obama can ill afford yet another Middle East war, with its inevitable cost in American lives. Yet he also cannot afford to stand back and allow Yemen to play the role for al-Qaida that Afghanistan played in the late 1990s.
        
        There are no simple answers. Washington may prefer to adopt the counterterror tactic of helping the Yemenis strike al-Qaida sites from the air, to avoid the sight of US soldiers deployed in a country so close to the Muslim holy city of Mecca.
        
        But whichever option the US chooses, the real "root cause" of the proliferating insurgencies in Yemen, and the inability of the regime to adequately deal with them, is the ongoing dysfunctionality of the region's political culture. All across the Middle East, failing, autocratic regimes face off against popular Islamist movements committed to a murderous and ultimately sterile political program.
        
        Yemen offers an example of this situation in a particularly virulent form.

    textlede: Pakistan: Al Qaeda's influence in Yemen
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Pakistan, Jan. 08 -- To get an idea of the state of mind of the men here in Yemen who run al-Qaeda in the Arabia peninsula, just take a look at what they said about the failed attack on the US airliner on Christmas Day.In a swaggering and ambitious statement, they claimed that they sent the Nigerian student onto the plane, and that he only failed because of a technical fault with the bomb.For them, getting that close counts as the next best thing to a successful mission. And take just one look at the terrain of this country to understand why al-Qaeda is feeling so comfortable here, relaxed enough for one of its leaders reportedly to have moved his wife and family down from Saudi Arabia.Yemen's mountains are rugged, hard to reach, and best of all from a jihadi point of view, they are not controlled by the central government.Al-Qaeda in the Arabian peninsula established itself in Yemen after it was forced out of Saudi Arabia, taking advantage of the fact that large swathes of Yemeni territory are controlled by powerful, well-armed tribes, not by a government that is getting closer to the US and its counter-terrorism advisers than ever.Already there are claims and counter-claims of a kind that are familiar from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq.On 17 and 24 December al-Qaeda sites in Yemen were attacked.
        
        Reports based on American sources suggested that 60 "militants" had been killed.It has been reported in the United States that American military forces carried out the attacks.But local journalists here who say they have visited the sites in question tell a different story.Abdulelah Hider Shaea, who has close connections with al-Qaeda, told me that people at the places that were attacked insist that dozens of women and children were among the dead.It is the belief of at least one person there, he said, that the Yemeni government and US President Barack Obama were congratulating each other on killing their children.Making deals with tribes that have lost large numbers of women and children in government attacks will be very difficult.Mr Shaea said that al-Qaeda in Yemen believes that American actions will bring it recruits.And he compared Yemen with Pakistan's tribal areas."The United States wants to fight al-Qaeda here. It won't work, they'll make this a new Waziristan, exporting fighters all over the world."A diverse range of observers, in Yemen and abroad, agree that a heavy-handed counter-terrorism strategy will create more problems than it will solve.But alternatives to military action move slowly and do not guarantee success either.In Washington, President Obama is under pressure to take action. The Christmas Day attempted attack over Detroit may have failed, but it brought back instant memories of 9/11. Military action will continue.Al-Qaeda is not Yemen's only problem.Saudi Arabia has intervened in the long-running tribal war in the north. A separatist movement in the south wants Yemen to be divided back into two countries.The poor are getting poorer. Levels of illiteracy are high. The birth rate is the highest in the Middle East.Its main export, oil, will run out within the next 10 years and new gas fields do not appear to be lucrative enough to replace it.Yemen's water supply is also running dry, not least because of the amount that is used to irrigate the fields of khat.Chewing khat leaves, which are a mild stimulant, is the national pastime.

    textlede: Obama takes blame in plane bomb plot
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        WASHINGTON | President Barack Obama declined to fire anyone Thursday for the lapses that allowed a suspected terrorist carrying explosives to board a plane for Detroit on Christmas Day, and said for the first time he bears the ultimate responsibility for any breach that endangers Americans.
        
        "I am less interested in passing out blame than I am in learning from and correcting these mistakes to make us safer, for ultimately the buck stops with me," Obama said.
        
        "As president, I have a solemn responsibility to protect our nation and our people, and when the system fails, it is my responsibility."
        
        The president said he had ordered steps to guard against a repeat, including making sure some agency is responsible for investigating all high-priority threats, directing that intelligence reports be distributed more quickly and to more people, strengthening analysis of raw intelligence reports and making it easier to add individuals to terrorist watch and no-fly lists.
        
        Obama had a new tone Thursday, taking responsibility himself and adding his White House staff to the list of government offices and agencies that failed to stop 23-year-old Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab from boarding Northwest Airlines Flight 253 despite numerous warning signs.
        
        In earlier statements, first from Hawaii and this week from the White House, Obama didn't mention his own responsibility, and on Tuesday he called the failures by intelligence agencies a massive screw-up.
        
        Obama spoke as the White House released a redacted summary of its internal review of the lapses that allowed Abdulmutallab onto the plane even though his father had told U.S. officials he was involved with Islamic militants. He had bought a one-way ticket with cash and he had no luggage.
        
        Abdulmutallab has been charged in a federal indictment with trying to blow up the plane, and has told investigators he was working with the al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula terror network.
        
        Although Obama aides had said the report on the Christmas attack would shock the country, it contained few new details. Its release was delayed twice Thursday as officials scrubbed it to make sure it didn't report anything that would reveal sources of intelligence.
        
        Obama said mistakes in three areas piled up from mid-October through late December and allowed Abdulmutallab to board the plane, allegedly with explosives.
        
        First, he said, U.S. intelligence officials "did not aggressively follow up on and prioritize" reports that Yemen-based al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula was planning an attack on the United States and recruiting people to carry it out.
        
        "The White House and the National Security Staff failed to identify this gap ahead of time," the White House report said.
        
        "No single component of the CT (counterterrorism) community assumed responsibility for the threat reporting and followed it through."
        
        Second, he said, the intelligence community "failed to connect the dots" that could have revealed that Abdulmutallab was planning the attack. Abdulmutallab's father told U.S. Embassy officials in Nigeria on Nov. 18 that his son may have been radicalized and was planning to go to Yemen.
        
        While information was "fragmentary and embedded in a large volume of other data," the White House report concluded, several U.S. agencies obtained reports about al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, its plans and Abdulmutallab over several months.
        
        "The U.S. government had sufficient information prior to the attempted Dec. 25 attack to have potentially disrupted the AQAP plot, by identifying Mr. Abdulmutallab as a likely operative of AQAP and potentially preventing him from boarding flight 253," the report said.
        
        "We saw the plot was developing. But at the time, we did not know, in fact, that they were talking about sending Mr. Abdulmutallab to the United States," said John Brennan, Obama's chief counter terrorism adviser.
        
        Third, Obama said, "shortcomings" in the system failed to move Abdulmutallab's name from a broad list of suspected threats to a narrower "no fly" list that would have kept him off any U.S.-bound plane.

    textlede: Secession drive impedes U.S. efforts against al-Qaeda
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        A hatred of the government in southern Yemen is complicating U.S.-backed efforts to stem al-Qaeda's ambitions across the region, according to Western and Yemeni officials, analysts and human rights activists.
        
        The concerns highlight the extent to which the United States, as it deepens its military engagement here, is teaming up with a government facing internal divisions that in some ways are more complex than those in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.
        
        In a speech Thursday, President Obama said the United States has worked closely with its partners, including Yemen, "to inflict major blows" against al-Qaeda. But experts familiar with the group here say it is poised to exploit the country's divide to attract recruits and more sympathy from the south's powerful tribes.
        
        "Al-Qaeda dreams of secession," said Najib Ghallab, a political science professor at Sanaa University.
        
        "It wants to turn the south into the perfect breeding ground for global terrorism."
        
        Once two countries, Yemen unified in 1990. But a brief civil war broke out in 1994. From the north, President Ali Abdullah Saleh dispatched thousands of Yemeni mujaheddin who had fought in Afghanistan as well as Salafists, who follow a strict interpretation of Islam, to fight the southerners.
        
        Ever since, tension has gripped this vast region. The government's resources are stretched thin here, as it also grapples with a Shiite rebellion in the north.
        
        Southerners contend that the government has denied them their share of oil revenue, and has dismissed many southerners from military and government jobs. A wave of protests has roiled the south, prompting a government crackdown. Many members of the Southern Movement, a loosely knit coalition, now demand secession.
        
        "We no longer want our rights from the government. We want a separate north and south," said Ahmed Kassim, a secessionist leader who spoke in a hushed tone inside a car on a recent day in this southern port city.
        
        In May, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the affiliate alleged to have masterminded the attempted bombing of an American jet on Christmas Day, declared its support for the southerners' demands for a separate state. The group's leader, Nasser al-Wuhayshi, promised to avenge the "oppression" faced by southerners.
        
        Al-Qaeda's bonds in south
        
        Southern Yemen, nestled at the tip of the Arabian Peninsula, edges the strategic Bab el-Mandab strait, one of the world's oil shipping choke points. It is also a gateway to Somalia, where the Islamist militant movement al-Shabab, which has ties to al-Qaeda, is fighting the U.S.-backed Somali transitional government.
        
        Al-Qaeda militants have thrived in Yemen's southern and southeastern provinces. They are shielded by tribal alliances and codes in religiously conservative communities that do not tolerate outside interference, even from the government. A shared dislike of central authority and U.S. policies in the Middle East has strengthened al-Qaeda's bonds with southern tribesmen.
        
        The resentment persists here in Aden, where al-Qaeda militants bombed the USS Cole in 2000, killing 17 American sailors.
        
        Inside the dented white car, Kassim sat with another secessionist leader, Nasser Atawil. Now and then, they looked nervously out the window, concerned that Yemeni intelligence agents might overhear their conversation with a journalist.
        
        They complained that the names of streets had been changed to northern ones. They said northerners had taken buildings, farms and land from southerners. Northerners, they contended, gain entry into better universities and had better careers.
        
        Atawil, a retired army general, said his pension was half what his northern counterparts receive.
        
        "What the government is doing will make al-Qaeda stronger here," he said.
        
        In another corner of Aden, the managing editor of Al Ayyam, the largest and most influential daily in the south, said the government has banned his paper for sympathizing with the Southern Movement's cause.
        
        "We are virtually under house arrest," Hani Bashraheel said. On Monday, journalists staged a sit-in to protest the shutdown. But clashes erupted between police and the paper's armed guards; a policeman and a guard were killed. On Wednesday, police arrested Hani and his father, Hisham Bashraheel, the paper's editor.
        
        According to Human Rights Watch, Yemeni forces opened fire on unarmed protesters six times in 2008 and 2009, killing at least 11 and wounding dozens.
        
        On Thursday, a senior Yemeni official denied the government was using excessive force and instead said some secessionists have targeted government forces.
        
        "They claim they are a movement, but they are outlaws," said Rashad al-Alimi, deputy prime minister for security and defense.
        
        Escalating tensions
        
        With the ongoing government repression, concern is growing that violence could increase -- especially as the U.S.-backed war on al-Qaeda unfolds in the south.
        
        Since July, there have been more reports of protesters bringing weapons to rallies, according to Human Rights Watch. In November, al-Qaeda militants killed three senior security officials and four escorts in the southern province of Hadhramaut.
        
        The recent alliance between a powerful tribal leader and former jihadist, Tariq al-Fadhli, and the Southern Movement also has escalated tensions. Fadhli, who is from the south, fought against the Soviets in Afghanistan. Then Saleh sent him to fight against the former Marxist forces in the south during the civil war.
        
        But in April, Fadhli broke ties with Saleh, injecting new momentum into the Southern Movement. Since then, protests against the government have intensified.
        
        The government has accused Fadhli and the Southern Movement of colluding with al-Qaeda. They have denied this and accuse Saleh of using the specter of al-Qaeda to elicit support from the United States and its Middle East allies.
        
        Still, some rights activists say an alliance is forming between some secessionists, Fadhli and al-Qaeda. Christoph Wilcke, a Human Rights Watch researcher for Yemen, said at least one al-Qaeda leader had joined Fadhli and the Southern Movement. He was killed in a U.S.-backed Yemeni airstrike last month, Wilcke said.
        
        Any melding of the Southern Movement and al-Qaeda is far from established, he said. But that could change if the U.S.-backed war deepens without Washington pressuring Saleh to stop repression in the south. Angry southerners, meanwhile, have accused the government and the United States of killing a few dozen civilians in an airstrike last month. Yemeni officials say they killed militants and their relatives.
        
        "It will change the sympathies if they have a common enemy in the United States," Wilcke said.
        
        "Al-Qaeda will become more of an ally. This is exactly what we don't want to get into."

    textlede: The Issues In Yemen; A foiled attack on a U.S. airliner has crystallized global fears about al-Qaeda in Yemen, an Arab state verging on collapse.
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Yemen sent thousands of troops into al-Qaeda strongholds throughout the country yesterday as it launched a major counterterrorism operation. The government announced the drive to shut down the Islamist group's mountain and desert bases. Government officials said security forces had been sent to Shabwa, Maarib and Abyan, lawless regions in the east and south where al-Qaeda's local affiliate, al-Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula, (AQAP) is strongest.
        
        SAUDIS AND YEMEN
        
        Saudi Arabia is the Yemeni government's biggest financial donor and most important ally, along with the United States, but some Yemenis resent the influence of their wealthy neighbour. The Saudis fear AQAP is trying to relaunch armed attacks from Yemen to destabilize the kingdom and possibly other U.S. allies in the oil-producing Gulf region. Disheartened by the failure of Yemeni forces to crush Zaydi Shiite rebels in the north, the Saudis themselves attacked the so-called Houthi insurgents, above, in November after a cross-border rebel raid.
        
        GUANTANAMO LINK
        
        In November 2007, the United States sent home six of 97 Yemenis from its Guantanamo Bay prison. These included Said Ali al-Shehri, above left, and his brother Yusuf Mohammed al-Shehri. Both were transferred to the Saudi government to undergo "jihadi rehab" training but escaped and returned to Yemen. Said Ali al-Shehri went on to become a leader of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, possibly the deputy leader, and may have been killed in an air strike in December. His brother died in a shootout earlier in the year. Another former Gitmo inmate, Fahd Saleh Suleiman al Jutayli, who was released in 2006, also died in a shootout last year. ABC Television named former al-Qaeda leader in Yemen Muhammad Attik al-Harbi, right, as another unrepentant former Guantanamo prisoner. Yesterday, the United States said it will not transfer any more prisoners from Guantanamo to Yemen.
        
        U. S . AID
        
        The United States has increased the amount of military equipment, intelligence and training it provides to Yemeni forces to root out al-Qaeda hideouts. The Pentagon's main publicly disclosed counterterrorism assistance program for Yemen has grown from US$4.6-million in fiscal 2006 to US$67-million in fiscal 2009. U.S. General David Petraeus has said that aid will more than double.
        
        RIPE FOR TERRORISM
        
        U.S. officials say civil war, poverty and lawlessness have made Yemen an ideal base for al-Qaeda, which has largely been pushed out of Afghanistan and has come under increasing military pressure to leave Pakistan's tribal areas. The Yemeni government is battling Shiite rebels in the north and faces separatist sentiment in the south. U.S. intelligence agencies view Yemen as the most active al-Qaeda affiliate outside of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
        
        U.S. AND YEMEN
        
        Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, below, pledged co-operation with the United States after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on U.S. cities and received military and economic aid in return. But by 2004 al-Qaeda appeared to be in disarray and U.S. interest waned. In 2006, Washington slashed aid to mark its wrath at Yemen's perceived lenience toward terrorists. The pendulum has now swung back. Alarmed at Yemen's slide toward chaos, the United States is throwing its weight behind a corruption-tainted government whose legitimacy and control is tenuous across swaths of the country.
        
        AL-QAEDA IN YEMEN
        
        The country is regarded as the spiritual base of al-Qaeda because it is the ancestral home of Osama bin Laden, whose father was born in the valley of Hadramawt. The Yemeni al-Qaeda Mujahedeen fought under bin Laden in Afghanistan. However, a new terrorist group emerged after a prison break in Yemen in 2006 in which 23 top al-Qaeda members escaped from a high-security jail. A year ago the group, members of the Saudi and Yemeni branches of al-Qaeda, formed al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. It is estimated that 300 al-Qaeda terrorists might be in Yemen.
        
        PITFALLS
        
        The population of 23 million is set to double in 20 years, even as gas exports fail to offset falling oil earnings and water supplies run dry, leading to increased poverty and economic turmoil. Deeper U.S. security involvement could increase al-Qaeda recruitment, said Yemeni analyst Abdul-Ghani al-Iryani. To defeat al-Qaeda, the U.S. is having to align itself with the autocratic regime of President Saleh, who has kept power by balancing tribal and military factions with a network of patronage.

    textlede: JUST WHAT WE NEED: ANOTHER WAR; IF THE UNITED STATES THINKS IT CAN SWOOP IN AND FIX YEMEN ... WELL, IT CAN'T
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        President Barack Obama's evident willingness to bite off yet another war in the Middle East -- this time in Yemen -- raises serious questions about his judgment as well as his independence from America's military and security establishment.
        
        Not counting Iraq, Yemen is second only to Somalia as the biggest mess in the Middle East. An uneasy and relatively recent amalgam of enemies North and South, and with a population of 24 million, it has been the venue of ongoing civil, regional and internal warfare for at least half a century. It is riddled by tribal and religious rivalries. A high percentage of Yemenis are addicted to the narcotic, khat.
        
        Khat is described as a mild stimulant, but I can witness from watching its effects among addicted Somalis that it produces on the part of those who chew it a dangerous combination of aggressiveness and haziness. It's sort of like, "Leave me alone or I'll kill you."
        
        Widespread khat chewing unstrings an economy. People pay a lot of attention to acquiring it. Users can be recognized by a green drool that oozes from their mouths as they chew it.
        
        The British took southern Yemen, then known as Aden, in 1838 and held onto it until 1967. At that point, Gamal Abdul Nasser's Egypt was supplying troops and arms to the Yemenis to help them get rid of the British. The British abandonment of Aden was the occasion of one of my favorite geopolitical jokes. They described their departure, in a reversal of the old line, as "ships leaving a sinking rat."
        
        Still, we will try to save from perdition Yemen, as big as Wyoming, with U.S. troops and military aid projected at from $70 million to $150 million, depending on how much the Congress is willing to put into Mr. Obama's latest Middle East enterprise.
        
        For me, coming on top of the unfinished Iraq war and the newly escalated Afghanistan war, the Yemen undertaking seems to be a dangerous act of folly.
        
        The putative U.S. enemy in Yemen is Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. By far the largest country in the Arabian peninsula is Saudi Arabia. Since 9/11, when 15 of the 19 attackers were Saudi by nationality, and, in fact, for many years before that, there has been considerable concern in the U.S. government over just where exactly Saudi Arabia stands in Middle Eastern affairs.
        
        It has always been clear that some so-called terrorist financing in the Middle East comes from wealthy Saudis. Their motivation has always been murky. Some of it can be put down to Sunni vs. Shiite Muslim rivalry. Part of the internal Yemen conflict is Sunni vs. Shiite, and Shiite Iran, Sunni Saudi Arabia's rival in the region, is suspected of helping Shiite Yemenis against the Sunni-dominated government.
        
        A second element to be assessed in trying to determine Saudi Arabia's real position on regional issues such as Yemen is the fact that many Saudis who are Sunni fundamentalists are quite happy to support al-Qaida and other of America's opponents. Some of these are the same Saudis who are comfortable watching their royal family-dominated government nestling under the protection of U.S. arms, safe from the potential depredations of the Saudi people. America provides this protection to assure its access not only to Saudi oil, but also to the continuing balancing position played by the Saudis in world oil councils.
        
        On that basis, it is worth asking what happens if a U.S. war on Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula has repercussions in what is a very vulnerable Saudi Arabia? Could the royal government in Riyadh survive an assault by determined opponents, particularly faced with an internal Fifth Column?
        
        What exactly is the logic for the United States in expanding the war into Yemen and potentially into Saudi Arabia? Is this a sensible response to what is clearly a failure of American internal intelligence coordination after eight-plus years of trying to strengthen it? Is this not a disproportionate response to a failed attack by a technologically challenged Nigerian? What's the matter with us if we overreact in this fashion to such an incident? What's the matter with Mr. Obama if he doesn't step in and restore equilibrium in U.S. policy in these circumstances?
        
        I also think decisions of the American and British governments to temporarily close their embassies in the Yemeni capital, Sana, didn't make sense, particularly in light of the U.S.-stated intention to increase military aid and other assistance in Yemen. Obviously, no one -- starting with me, a retired American diplomat whose experience included Lebanon and Somalia -- wants to see American or British envoys blown up by suicide bombers. But in Somalia the American Embassy was the last ship to leave the sinking rat.
        
        In my view it is vital that professional American and British diplomatic eyes and ears be present in Yemen to serve as an interlocuter with Yemen president Ali Abdallah Saleh and other political and economic elements in the country, particularly as things get rough and if the U.S. role there expands. What's Mr. Saleh supposed to do otherwise -- call someone, hoping his network includes some senior U.S. official somewhere? There are all manner of security measures in an American Embassy's repertoire to enable U.S. diplomats to stay alive in what we will call "difficult circumstances."
        
        To be blind in Sana, particularly forgoing the wise counsel of the British, who have been paying more attention than us to Yemen since 1838, would be nuts. It also would probably be a Washington decision, taken by people who want to cover their posteriors in the event of something nasty happening in Sana, rather than the recommendation of the American leadership in the Yemeni capital. For the moment, the decision to close the embassy in Sana seems to have been rescinded.
        
        So here we are, expanding the list of our Middle East wars with no solid rationale and no obvious thought to what could happen in Saudi Arabia. Amateur hour in these affairs costs blood as well as money.
        
        Mr. Obama?

    textlede: Kuwait: Al Qaeda"s Yemen connection
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Pakistan, Jan. 06 -- The attempt to destroy Northwest Airlines flight 253 en route from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day underscores the growing ambition of Al Qaeda"s Yemen franchise, which has grown from a largely Yemeni agenda to become a player in the global Islamic jihad in the last year. Since merging with the Al Qaeda franchise in Saudi Arabia last January and renaming itself Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), it has stepped up operations in Yemen itself, struck into Saudi Arabia, and now operates on the global stage. The weak Yemeni government of President Ali Abdallah Salih, which has never fully controlled the country and now faces a host of growing problems, will need significant American support to defeat AQAP.Al Qaeda has long been active in Yemen, the original homeland of Osama bin Laden"s family, and one of its first major terror attacks was conducted in Aden in 2000, when an Al Qaeda cell nearly sank the USS Cole.
        
        A year ago, the Al Qaeda franchises in Saudi Arabia and Yemen merged after the Saudi branch had been effectively repressed by the Saudi authorities under the leadership of Deputy Interior Minister Prince Muhammad bin Nayif. The new AQAP showed its claws last August, when it almost assassinated the prince with a suicide bomber who had passed through at least two airports on the way to his attempt on Nayif.The same bomb makers who produced that device probably also manufactured the bomb that Omar Al Farooq Abdulmutallab used on Flight 253. In claiming credit for the Detroit attack, AQAP highlighted how they had built a bomb that "all the advanced, new machines and technologies and the security boundaries of the world"s airports" had failed to detect. They praised their "mujahedin brothers in the manufacturing sector" for building such a "highly advanced device," and promised that more such attacks will follow.Yemen has sought to repress Al Qaeda off and on for the last decade, with little success. The Saleh government has other more immediate problems on its plate, in particular a rebellion among Shia Zaydi tribes known as Houthis in the north that has escalated in the last two months with attacks by the rebels into Saudi territory. The southern part of the country, which only merged with the north in 1990 and fought a bitter civil war in 1994 when it tried to break away, is hostile to the Saleh government and is looking for a chance to split again. The economy is weak and heavily dependent on dwindling oil reserves, and the majority of the 23 million Yemenis are illiterate and poor.The Obama administration has offered Saleh additional military assistance, and has encouraged the government to strike hard at Al Qaeda hideouts in the last few weeks. The attacks have killed some AQAP leaders, but it is unclear exactly how serious a blow these attacks have inflicted on the group as a whole. AQAP has vowed revenge for the strikes, which it blames on an alliance between America, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the Saleh government.AQAP has also provided refuge for the Yemeni American cleric Shaykh Anwar Al Awlaki. Al Awlaki was in contact with US Army Major Nidal Hassan, who killed 13 soldiers at Fort Hood in Texas on Nov. 5, 2009. In an interview with Al Jazeera released on Dec. 23, Awlaki said he had encouraged Nidal to kill his fellow soldiers because they were preparing to go to Afghanistan and were part of the Zionist Crusader alliance that Al Qaeda says it is fighting. The next day, Dec. 24, Awlaki was reported to be among those killed in a Yemeni American strike on the AQAP leadership, but that is still unconfirmed. In claiming credit for the Christmas Day airline attack, AQAP also lauded the Fort Hood massacre and urged other American Muslims to emulate Nidal Hassan.Al Qaeda has always found weak and failing states like Yemen to be its best staging bases and sanctuaries. Along with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Somalia, Yemen offers an ideal location to operate with little outside interference. The president has been right to focus additional resources on combating AQAP, but the battle has just begun. If the Yemeni state becomes further destabilized, bin Laden"s cadre in the Arabian Peninsula will have more room to operate. The attack on the Amsterdam Detroit flight also shows that Al Qaeda remains obsessed with striking the American airline industry, a target it has gone after repeatedly since 1999. If AQAP has now been told by the Al Qaeda core leadership to take on the job, we can probably assume that other Al Qaeda franchises in North Africa, Iraq, Southeast Asia and elsewhere have also been pressed to attack.A former CIA officer, Bruce Riedel focuses on political transition, terrorism and conflict resolution. He was a senior advisor to three US presidents on Middle East and South Asian issues. At the request of President Obama he chaired an interagency review of policy toward Afghanistan and Pakistan for the White House that was completed in March 2009.

    textlede: No longer a fighter, but still loyal to bin Laden; Ex-bodyguard one of thousands of former guerrillas in Yemen
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        When he served in the Afghan mountains as Osama bin Laden's bodyguard, Nasser al-Bahri said, he was known as "The Killer."
        
        Today, Bahri is a business consultant in Yemen who favors Western-style pinstriped shirts, crisp slacks and black loafers. But his ideas are still radical: Ask him whether jihadists should kill Americans on U.S. soil and he replies without hesitation, "America is a legitimate target."
        
        The arc of Bahri's life helps to explain why Yemen was an attractive place for Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the 23-year-old Nigerian who allegedly tried to bomb a Detroit-bound airliner on Christmas Day, to be indoctrinated into the Islamist world of jihad. Thousands like Bahri, who have returned from wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and other Muslim lands, are disengaged from the fight against the West, yet express sympathy for al-Qaeda's violent core philosophies.
        
        As the United States steps up its engagement here, it faces the delicate task of fighting terrorism without alienating Yemen's highly tribal and religiously conservative society. Like Pakistan and Afghanistan, Yemen has abundant weapons and men experienced in guerrilla warfare who resent U.S. policies and have tribal, social and inspirational ties to al-Qaeda. Many fear that such men could become perfect recruits, especially if anti-American sentiments grow or Yemen plunges deeper into chaos.
        
        "These people are already angry and many are unemployed," said Abdul-Ghani al-Iryani, a Yemeni political analyst.
        
        "The only option they will have if fighting starts is to join al-Qaeda. Where else will they go?"
        
        He added that Yemen is a place where "you cannot prevent contacts between young impressionable men and their jihadist heroes."
        
        Some of al-Qaeda's best-known figures, many with strong connections to bin Laden, live in this Middle Eastern nation led by a weak government and beset by multiple emergencies, from civil war to soaring poverty and dwindling oil reserves.
        
        Abdul Majid al-Zindani, bin Laden's former spiritual adviser, whom the United States has classified as a terrorist, is the most powerful religious figure here today. Senior Yemeni officials both fear him and seek his support. Nasser al-Wuhayshi -- bin Laden's former personal secretary -- is the leader of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which U.S. officials believe trained Abdulmutallab and equipped him with chemical explosives.
        
        U.S. and Yemeni investigators are also looking into a possible relationship between Abdulmutallab and Anwar al-Aulaqi, the extremist Yemeni American cleric who U.S. and Yemeni officials allege is one of the emerging spiritual leaders in al-Qaeda.
        
        Aulaqi has also been linked to the man charged with killing 13 people at Fort Hood, Tex., on Nov. 5.
        
        In an interview in a sunny room filled with computers at a business conference where he was working, Bakri, 37, said he has kept a relatively low profile in Yemen since 2002, when he was released from prison.
        
        He said Yemeni authorities held him for nearly two years without charge.
        
        He said he is no longer an al-Qaeda member and has no desire to return to a life of jihad. But he said he still admires bin Laden and his cause.
        
        "He is a man of substance," said Bahri, oval-faced and bald with piercing black eyes.
        
        "Whatever mistakes he has made, he has a very pure personality. He's simple, holy and sacred."
        
        'I decided to join'
        
        Bahri, who was interviewed a few days before the failed bombing on Northwest Airlines Flight 253, was born in 1972 in Saudi Arabia to Yemeni parents. He grew up in the kingdom and earned a business degree in college. But like so many young Saudis, Bahri was deeply influenced by Sunni fundamentalist preachers and the Palestinian struggles against Israel.
        
        In 1993, he said, he traveled to Bosnia to join Muslims fighting the Serbs. Bahri was following a well-worn path. Thousands of Yemenis went to Afghanistan in the 1980s to fight the Soviets. They were welcomed back as heroes. President Ali Abdullah Saleh dispatched many to fight in the south during Yemen's 1994 civil war.
        
        Bahri said he had no desire to return to Saudi Arabia or Yemen. After Bosnia, he traveled on fake passports to Somalia and then Tajikistan, eventually arriving in 1996 in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. There, he heard bin Laden rail against U.S. actions in the Persian Gulf War and preach that Muslims needed to be unified against the West.
        
        "I decided to join," recalled Bahri, who was sent to a training camp in Khost province. A year later, he said, he took an oath of loyalty to bin Laden.
        
        One night, a group of armed defectors from the Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist group that ruled Afghanistan, entered bin Laden's compound seeking to kill him. Bahri picked up his gun and shielded bin Laden.
        
        "After this, every time Osama bin Laden moved, he would say, 'Abu Jandal should be with us,' " recalled Bahri, using his nom de guerre.
        
        Nine months later, Bahri was shot in his left leg during a battle against Afghan rebels seeking to oust the Taliban. Bin Laden brought him food, changed his bandages and nursed him while he healed.
        
        "He would pour honey into my injury," Bahri recalled.
        
        Failed 'dialogue'
        
        In 2000, Bahri said, he had a falling-out with other al-Qaeda members and decided to visit Yemen with his Yemeni wife. Two months later, al-Qaeda militants bombed the USS Cole in the southern city of Aden, killing 17 American sailors. Bahri said he was not involved in the attack.
        
        But he said he was on a Yemeni security list of al-Qaeda operatives, so he went into hiding. When he tried to flee to Afghanistan, Yemeni intelligence agents captured him at the airport.
        
        Bahri said he was imprisoned without charges. Seven months later, after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, FBI agents arrived to interrogate him. In testimony before the U.S. Senate in May, former FBI agent Ali Soufan said interrogators obtained from Bahri "a treasure trove of highly significant actionable intelligence," including extensive information on bin Laden's terrorism network, its structure and its leadership. Bahri, he added, also provided "explicit details" of the Sept. 11 plot.
        
        Bahri said that although he fed the FBI lies, he believes his former al-Qaeda comrades view him as a traitor.
        
        After his prison term, including 13 months in solitary confinement, Bahri entered a prison rehabilitation program. Run by a prominent judge, Hamoud al-Hitar, it focused on using theological "arguing" as a tool of reform. It is now widely considered a failure. Bahri, along with two al-Qaeda militants convicted by the United States in the Cole bombings, were released after three sessions of "dialogue" over four months.
        
        "Hitar said he changed our minds," Bahri said.
        
        "But he did not."
        
        A latent danger
        
        After Bahri's release, employers were reluctant to hire him. He has had eight jobs in the past six years and earns a meager income. He said he once considered returning to Afghanistan but found it too risky. He was under surveillance by Yemeni intelligence and had to report to its officials every month.
        
        Those who know Bahri say he has given up militancy. Iryani, the political analyst, said Bahri has talked young Yemenis out of going to fight in Iraq.
        
        Iryani said former militants like Bahri need more support from the government. Without it, he said, "if they find the country to be under attack from outside, they will find a legitimate reason to go back to jihad."

    textlede: Yemen kills rebels it says behind threat to US Embassy
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Yemeni forces on Monday killed at least two Al-Qaeda militants they said were behind a threat which forced the US and European embassies to shut as concerns grew about the impoverished Arab country's stability. The raid took place after the attempted bombing of a US-bound plane on Christmas Day thrust Yemen into the foreground of the US-led war against Islamist militants.

        SANAA: Yemeni forces on Monday killed at least two Al-Qaeda militants they said were behind a threat which forced the US and European embassies to shut as concerns grew about the impoverished Arab country's stability. The raid took place after the attempted bombing of a US-bound plane on Christmas Day thrust Yemen into the foreground of the US-led war against Islamist militants.
        
        "Security authorities had been monitoring them for several days and struck today," a Yemeni security official told Reuters.
        
        "These elements are believed to be behind the threats directed to the US Embassy."
        
        The US Embassy in Sanaa stayed shut for a second day in response to what it said was Al-Qaeda threats. Britain's embassy has also been closed since Sunday.
        
        Other European countries, including France and Italy, limited access to their embassies on Monday, as did Japan.
        
        Security has been high in a residential area of the capital Sanaa that houses several embassies since before the current threats, with army vehicles blocking several streets.
        
        Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Yemen branch of Osama bin Laden's network, claimed responsibility for the December 25 attempt to blow up a US passenger plane carrying 300 people.
        
        It said the attempt was retaliation for US involvement in Yemen and its support for the government's offensive against the militants.
        
        US President Barack Obama said in response it was a priority to help the Yemeni government strike Al-Qaeda.
        
        Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the 23-year-old Nigerian accused of trying to blow up a plane as it approached Detroit, spent time in Yemen last year where US officials believe he received training from a militant group.
        
        The events have swung the focus of Washington's war on Islamist militants onto Yemen while US forces are fighting a strengthening Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan and are still committed in Iraq.
        
        Placed strategically on the Arabian Peninsula's southern rim, Yemen, the poorest Arab country, sits on shrinking oil reserves and faces a water crisis. Its population of 23 million is set to double in 20 years.
        
        A Shiite revolt in the north and separatist unrest in the south have also flared up in recent days.
        
        In the southern port city of Aden on Monday, one soldier
        
        was killed and three were wounded in clashes with protesters, a security official said.
        
        A pro-southern website said troops had opened fire on demonstrators and shot the soldier by mistake.
        
        Separatists want an independent southern Yemen, which unified with the north in 1990 and failed to secede in a 1994 war.
        
        In the north, Shiite rebels - who complain of social, economic and religious marginalization - said air strikes by Saudi war planes killed 16 Yemenis over the last two days.

    textlede: US and UK keep Yemen embassies shut for second day
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Britain, the US and three other European nations either kept their embassies closed or restricted public access amid fears of an attack by the local wing of al-Qaeda, which has been blamed for trying to blow up an airliner on Christmas Day. The British and American embassies in Yemen's capital, Sana'a, remained closed for a second day. A state department spokesperson said the situation would be assessed day by day, based on a perceived threat to US personnel. The Foreign Office said it was reviewing the situation.
        
        France's foreign ministry said its embassy in the city had also been shut to the public since Monday, although staff are still working in the building. Spain and Italy had also restricted public access to their missions, officials said. The closures came as the BBC quoted reports from the country saying the security alert had been caused when Yemen's military lost six trucks containing explosives and other armaments. Yemen said today its soldiers had killed two al-Qaeda militants during fighting in the Arhab region, north-east of Sana'a. Last month saw a series of government raids in the region against suspected al-Qaeda cells. Yemeni government officials, speaking anonymously to the Associated Press, said security forces had attacked al-Qaeda militants including Nazeeh al-Hanaq, a senior figure on Yemen's most wanted list, as they moved through the mountainous area. Hanaq escaped, but two others with him were killed, they said. While AP said the fighting was not directly linked to the embassy closures, Reuters quoted another official as saying the militants targeted "are believed to be behind the threats directed to the US embassy". Officials in London and Washington said the decision to close the missions was a result of specific intelligence. John Brennan, the US counterterrorism chief, said the American embassy, which was attacked twice in 2008, was shut because of "indications al-Qaeda is planning to carry out an attack against a target inside of Sana'a -- possibly our embassy. We're not going to take any chances with the lives of embassy personnel," he said. The embassy closures came a day after the top US commander for the Middle East, General David Petraeus, visited Yemen to pledge support from Barack Obama for the government's campaign against al-Qaeda and a doubling of America's $67-million counterterrorism assistance. Gordon Brown told the BBC on Monday that "we've got to do more" to combat terrorism in Yemen and called for a conference in London at the end of the month to discuss what more the international community could do to contain the growing al-Qaida threat from there. Brown said Britain would step up its own support for counterterrorist units and Yemeni coastguard operations, but Downing Street later said the money would be allocated from within the existing Yemen aid budget. The US has been training Yemeni counterterrorist forces for several years and Petraeus said that support would be doubled. But experts on the region said without more help Yemen risked becoming a failed state, similar to Somalia. Ginny Hill, a specialist on Yemen at the Chatham House thinktank, said the attacks were "a symptom of a much deeper underlying problem, the collapse of the state system". She said Yemen was reliant on oil revenues which are expected to dwindle to nothing over the next decade.
        
        "It's not as if you're starting at a static position, you're working on a downward trajectory," she said. Over the weekend, Obama named al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula as the group behind the attempt by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab on Christmas Day to bomb a commercial airliner landing in Detroit. Claiming responsibility last week, the al-Qaeda affiliate urged Muslims to start "killing every crusader who works at their embassies or other places". Amid the heightened al-Qaeda threat against western targets, several international aid and development agencies working in Yemen have begun to restrict their operations and tighten security. Naseem ur-Rahman, a spokesperson for Unicef, the UN children's fund which is providing aid to tens of thousands of impoverished families displaced by the war against the northern Huthi rebels, said the agency had been working with a reduced staff in Sana'a since the heightened security threats last month.
        
        "All our frontline UN staff are still in place and we will not move any until we receive a signal from the government," said Rahman.
        
        "But we are working with a reduced staff in Sana'a because of the latest security concerns."
        
        Andrew Moore, the British director of Save the Children in Yemen, said his agency had pulled out all foreign staff from their office in Abyan, the scene of a US-backed air strike on 17 December aimed at al-Qaeda leaders, but which local sources said killed as many as 50 people, including women and children. Moore said staff were avoiding high profile restaurants and hotels in Sana'a, were travelling in unmarked cars and had recently hired an international security consultant to travel to Yemen to oversee their operation.
        
        "There's quite a lot of anger in Abyan and this is a nervous time," said Moore.
        
        "The expectation is that al-Qaeda will try and do something big in revenge [for the Yemeni attacks]. The big question is, will they try hit a soft target."
        
        Both American and British embassies have been targeted in recent years. In 2008, 19 people were killed by a bomb attack on the US embassy while an al-Qaeda plot to bomb the British mission was foiled three years earlier. Since then, security has been stepped up dramatically. Perched on a hill in northern Sana'a, the British embassy is surrounded by blast walls, security cameras and razor wire, while its main buildings are dug deep into the hillside, meaning key offices are underground. A few kilometres away, the US embassy is also heavily guarded, set back from the main road and surrounded by heavily fortified checkpoints with blast walls, ramps and several layers of heavily armed security. - guardian.co.uk © Guardian News and Media 2010

    textlede: Yemen kills two terrorists; Embassies Shut; Al-Qaeda agents were behind threats to U.S., government says
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Yemeni forces yesterday killed at least two al-Qaeda terrorists they said were behind a threat that forced the U.S. and European embassies to close, as concern grew about the poor Arab country's stability.
        
        The raid took place after the attempted bombing of a U.S.-bound plane on Christmas Day thrust Yemen into the foreground of the U.S.-led war against Islamist militants.
        
        U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said fighting in Yemen was a threat to regional and global stability.
        
        "We see global implications from the war in Yemen and the ongoing efforts by al-Qaeda in Yemen to use it as a base for terrorist attacks far beyond the region," she said.
        
        The West and Saudi Arabia fear al-Qaeda will take advantage of Yemen's instability to spread its operations to the neighbouring kingdom, the world's biggest oil exporter, and beyond. Yemen itself produces a small amount of oil.
        
        A Yemeni security official said terrorists targeted in yesterday's raid were behind the threats to the U.S. embassy.
        
        "Security authorities had been monitoring them for several days and struck today," he said.
        
        Agents were hunting Mohammed al-Haniq, a local al-Qaeda leader, but he was able to get away, state media reported.
        
        The U.S. embassy in Sana'a stayed shut for a second day in response to what it said was al-Qaeda threats. Britain's embassy has also been closed since Sunday.
        
        Other European countries, including France and Italy, limited access to their embassies yesterday, as did Japan.
        
        The Daily Telegraph reported that fears of a terrorist strike against Western embassies in Yemen grew with claims that lorries laden with explosives had been smuggled into the capital.
        
        Terrorists driving six trucks filled with weapons and ordnance were thought to have entered the city.
        
        The identity of those who smuggled the weapons consignment into Sana'a has not been disclosed, and it is unclear whether they were linked to al-Qaeda's powerful Yemeni branch.
        
        Although an Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) statement on Sunday urged its followers to kill all Western diplomats
        
        on the Arab Peninsula, Western officials have not divulged whether specific threats have been made.
        
        Diplomats dismissed speculation that the vanishing convoy could presage an imminent attack on Western interests in the city.
        
        "These reports have nothing to do with the reason embassies were shut," one said.
        
        John Brennan, President Barack Obama's counter-terrorism adviser, has spoken of "indications" that al-Qaeda was planning an attack on a Western target in Sana'a, possibly the U.S. embassy, which was attacked twice in 2008, killing 19 people.
        
        AQAP, the regional wing of Osama bin Laden's network, said it was behind the Dec. 25 attempt to blow up a U.S. passenger plane carrying 300 people from Amsterdam to Detroit.
        
        It said the attempt was in retaliation for U.S. involvement in Yemen and its support for the government's offensive against the terrorists.

    textlede: In Fragile Yemen, U.S. Faces Leader Who Puts Family First
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        The United States is quickly ramping up its aid to Yemen, which Washington sees as a revived new front against Al Qaeda. But one of the most delicate tasks will be managing the relationship with the president of Yemen, Ali Abdullah Saleh, who has filled his government with numerous members of his family and who wants to ensure that his son Ahmed succeeds him, Yemeni officials, analysts and Western diplomats say.
        
        Mr. Saleh, 67, is wily, witty and fit. But he has been spending less time in the past two years managing the complicated tribal and regional demands of fragile Yemen than trying to consolidate the power of his family, the analysts say. As Yemen's oil revenues erode and Mr. Saleh has fewer resources to spread around, the reach of the central government has been shrinking -- "the government is practically caged in the capital," Sana, one senior Western diplomat said.
        
        Mr. Saleh presents the Obama administration with a problem that is all too familiar in Afghanistan and Pakistan. He is amenable to American support, but his ineffective and corrupt bureaucracy has limited reach. And his willingness to battle Al Qaeda, which he does not view as his main enemy, is questionable.
        
        Much of Yemen is in turmoil. Government forces on Monday killed two militants suspected of being with Al Qaeda. There is another round of rebellion in the north and a growing secessionist movement in the south. In important provinces where key oil resources are and where Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is strong, government troops and the police largely remain in their barracks or in the central cities. Order outside the cities is kept by tribal chiefs, with their own complicated loyalties.
        
        "You can't see anyone in a government uniform in Abyan," said Murad Zafir, a Yemeni political analyst, referring to a southern province.
        
        "There are large areas of the country where there is no electricity, no running water and no central authority."
        
        United States aid was paltry until last year, and it was only when American intelligence could show Mr. Saleh that his family was being singled out by Al Qaeda that he began to take the group's threat seriously, diplomats said.
        
        How effectively Yemen addresses the threat depends largely on Mr. Saleh's family. Ahmed Saleh is head of the Yemen Republican Guard and the country's special forces.
        
        The president's nephews -- sons of his late brother -- include Amar, the deputy director for national security; Yahye, head of the central security forces and the counterterrorism unit; and Tarek, head of the Presidential Guard. The president's half brother is head of the air force.
        
        The sense of Yemen as a family corporation that has also enriched itself is part of the problem, Mr. Zafir said; the president's mosque, al-Saleh Mosque, was completed less than two years ago and is said to have cost at least $120 million.
        
        "President Saleh wants his son to succeed him," Mr. Zafir said. To make that happen, he has sought to consolidate power in his family's hands, but his influence over the tribal chiefs has receded, Mr. Zafir said.
        
        Najeeb Saeed Ghanem, a former minister of health, is a member of Parliament from the largest opposition party, Islah, an Islamist party with close ties to tribal groups.
        
        "It is the size of the deterioration of the regime and its control over the country that we're afraid of," he said.
        
        With oil revenues down, Mr. Saleh has had to turn to outside allies to help finance the war in the north. Saudi Arabia provided $2 billion last year to make up for the budget shortfall -- an amount that dwarfs the $150 million in security assistance that the United States will ask Congress to approve for the 2010 fiscal year.
        
        "The Saudis understand," said Ahmed M. al-Kibsi, a political scientist at Sana University, "that they are the real prize for Al Qaeda, and Yemen is the platform."
        
        But there are challenges to Mr. Saleh's goals of empowering his son, if not direct challenges to Mr. Saleh. One of his main allies, even as a young lieutenant colonel in 1977 when he initially took power in the north, was Ali Mohsen. Now he is the military commander in charge of the effort to stamp out the Houthi rebellion to the north. The Houthis are Shiites, and Mr. Mohsen is said to be a Sunni religious conservative.
        
        Mr. Saleh and Mr. Mohsen are not related and are not considered rivals for the presidency. But Mr. Mohsen has signaled that he does not favor a direct succession of Ahmed Saleh to the presidency, diplomats and analysts said. Mr. Mohsen believes, they said, that the younger Mr. Saleh lacks the personal strength and charisma of his father and cannot hold the country together.
        
        The tension between the two old comrades is visible in the criticism of the way the war in the north is being handled, with government officials sometimes complaining that Mr. Mohsen set off renewed fighting there by occupying or destroying the mosques and holy places of the Houthis and building Sunni mosques and schools in the area. Mr. Mohsen's supporters have countered that the war has not been fully supported by the central government.
        
        Mr. Saleh and his son also face another internal challenge from the next generation of the powerful Ahmar family, Yemeni bluebloods. Sheik Abdullah al-Ahmar was the chief of the powerful Hashed tribe, founded the Islah party and was Parliament speaker until his death in December 2007. One of his sons, Hamid al-Ahmar, a businessman in his 40s, now leads Islah.
        
        Mr. Saleh has tried to keep the family close, in particular by letting Hamid al-Ahmar invest in major cash cows, like the main cellphone company, SabaFon, oil interests and the Bank of Saba. But in August, Hamid al-Ahmar stunned Yemenis by appearing on Al Jazeera to describe Mr. Saleh as having overstayed his time and calling on him to leave office and not try to enthrone his son.
        
        "If Saleh wants the people of Yemen to be on his side against monarchy and defend national unity, he himself must quit pursuing monarchy," he said.
        
        How the United States manages Mr. Saleh and his family ambitions will have much to do with success or failure against Al Qaeda.
        
        "Washington must work with and behind the regime, whatever its flaws, while trying to push Saleh toward reconciliation with his opponents," a Western diplomat said.
        
        "I am afraid it will take more delicacy than the Pentagon can do."

    textlede: Inside Obama's War on Terrorism
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Peter Baker is a White House correspondent for The Times and a contributing writer for the magazine.
        
        
        
        The evening before he was sworn into office, Barack Obama stepped out of Blair House, the government residence where he was staying across from the White House, and climbed into an armored limousine for the ride to a bipartisan dinner. Joining him in the back seat were John Brennan, his new counterterrorism adviser, and two foreign-policy advisers, Denis McDonough and Mark Lippert. The three men with the president-elect were out of breath, having rushed more than a mile from transition headquarters on foot after failing to find a taxi in Washington's preinaugural madness. As the motorcade moved out, they updated Obama on gathering evidence of a major terrorist plot to attack his inauguration. After a weekend of round-the-clock analysis, the nation's intelligence agencies were concerned that the threat was real, the men told him. A group of Somali extremists was reported to be coming across the border from Canada to detonate explosives as the new president took the oath of office. With more than a million onlookers viewing the ceremony from the National Mall and hundreds of millions more watching on television around the world, what could be a more devastating target?
        
        "All the data points suggested there was a real threat evolving quickly that had an overseas component," Juan Carlos Zarate, President George W. Bush's deputy national security adviser for combating terrorism, told me in November. As the inauguration approached, signs of a plot "seemed to be growing in credibility and relevance."
        
        Another senior Bush official involved in those tense events a year ago said last fall that protecting the new president was not enough. Even a failed attack would send a debilitating message to the world.
        
        "If something happens on the podium and there's chaos," this official told me, "that's the first time you see the new president, and you really don't want that."
        
        The threat seemed to weigh on Obama. He canceled a practice session to go over his inaugural address with aides at Blair House. David Axelrod, his senior adviser, later interpreted that as a sign that Obama was thinking about the suspected plot.
        
        "He seemed more subdued than he had been," Axelrod told me not long ago. Obama had not yet taken office, and he was already being confronted with the threat that consumed his predecessor's presidency. No matter how much he thought about terrorism as a senator or as a presidential candidate, it was another thing to face it as the person responsible for the nation's security -- and quite another thing again to know the threat was aimed directly at himself, his wife and their two daughters.
        
        "It's not as if you don't know what you're getting into," Axelrod said.
        
        "But when the reality comes and the baton is being passed and you're now dealing with real terrorism threats, it's a very sobering moment."
        
        There was little Obama could do but ask questions and rely on the people who had been fighting this fight for years. His advisers worked side by side with the outgoing administration. The two teams gathered in the Situation Room of the White House shortly before the inauguration to sift through what was known and to hash out what should be done about it. The final iteration of Bush's team sat across the table from the brain trust of Obama's administration -- Condoleezza Rice, Stephen Hadley and their colleagues on one side, Hillary Rodham Clinton, James Jones and their colleagues on the other.
        
        Clinton immediately put her finger on the problem. According to participants, she asked, what should Obama do if he is in the middle of his inaugural address and a bomb goes off somewhere on the mall? "Is the Secret Service going to whisk him off the podium so the American people see their incoming president disappear in the middle of the inaugural address?" she asked.
        
        "I don't think so."
        
        Among those in the room was Robert Gates, who served two years as Bush's defense secretary and would remain in that post under Obama. After the meeting, everyone eventually agreed that Gates should stay away from the inauguration in a secret location. With no other member of Obama's cabinet confirmed by the Senate, Gates -- an incumbent cabinet officer who also had the imprimatur of the newly elected commander in chief -- was the most logical person in the line of succession to take over the presidency should the worst happen.
        
        At the heart of the deliberations about what to do was John Brennan, a former C.I.A. officer. A Middle East specialist known for setting up the National Counterterrorism Center for Bush, Brennan was coming back after three years out of government as the top counterterrorism official in the Obama administration. He had wanted to be C.I.A. director but found his potential appointment sunk by liberal protests over his ties to the old order, so instead he was made deputy national security adviser for homeland security and counterterrorism, a position that did not require Senate confirmation.
        
        As he helped manage the inaugural threat, culling reports and coordinating between two administrations, Brennan was already becoming the most important voice in the ear of the new president as he moved to reshape the nation's struggle with terrorists. If it is now Obama's war, Brennan is his general. And the first battle set the tone.
        
        "It was a poignant reminder of the seriousness of the issue the president would be facing, on the eve of the inauguration," Brennan told me in November.
        
        Brennan suspected that the threat was a classic "poison pen," when one group of radicals rats out another group to get Americans to take out its rivals, and he was right. In this case, officials familiar with the situation said, some Somali extremists knew that a rival group was traveling to the United States and planted false information about its intentions that got back to the Americans. In the end, what for 72 hours looked like a credible threat turned out to be a false alarm.
        
        For a fledgling president, the incident would be a lesson in the fluid, murky nature of terrorism. The challenge of leading the struggle against violent extremists is more than just hunting down bad guys; it's distinguishing between what's real and what's not, tracking down where threats begin, figuring out the right response and finding a balance between acknowledging danger and projecting confidence. The Obama administration spent its first year in office trying to find its balance.
        
        Barack Obama was inaugurated as the first president to take office in the Age of Terrorism. He inherited two struggles -- one with Al Qaeda and its ideological allies, and another that divides his own country over issues like torture, prosecutions, security and what it means to be an American. The first has proved to be complicated and daunting. The second makes the first look easy.
        
        The attempted bombing of a Northwest Airlines passenger jet on Christmas Day heightened a debate that has percolated over the last 12 months. Obama's approach has been either a dangerous reversal of the Bush years or a consolidation of the Bush years, depending on who is talking. In fact, the new president, during his first year, has adopted the bulk of the counterterrorism strategy he found on his desk when he arrived in the Oval Office, a strategy already moderated from the earliest days after Sept. 11, 2001. He did, however, shave back some of the harsher edges of the remaining Bush policies and in the process of his recalibrations drew simultaneous fire from former Vice President Dick Cheney and the American Civil Liberties Union.
        
        Obama, then, found himself in a place where he seems most comfortable, splitting the difference on a tough issue and presenting it as the course of reasoned judgment rather than of dogmatic ideology. Where Bush saw black and white, Obama sees gray. Where Bush favored swagger, Obama is searching for a more supple blend of force and intellect. Where Bush saw Islamic extremism as an existential threat equivalent to Nazism or Communism, Obama contends that that view warps the situation out of proportion and plays into terrorists' hands by elevating their stature and allowing them -- even without attacking again -- to alter the nature of American society.
        
        With joblessness still plaguing the economy and health care dominating his agenda, Obama has not wanted his presidency to be defined by the war on terror, as Bush's was. He has given few public speeches on the topic and declined to discuss it for this article. Rather than seeing terrorism as the challenge of our time, Obama rejects the phrase "war on terror" altogether, hoping to recast the struggle as one of a number of vital challenges confronting America. The nation is at war with Al Qaeda, Obama says, but not with terrorism, which, as he understands it, is a tactic, not an enemy.
        
        "There was a tendency on the part of some to view the world through that prism -- you know, are you with us or against us, black and white, this global war on terror," John Brennan told me a couple of months ago in his windowless, low-ceilinged, soundproof office in the West Wing, where mobile phones are banned.
        
        "It was almost all-consuming. It was the driving force for our foreign policies, that we were now engaged in this march on the global war on terror."
        
        That attitude, Brennan went on to say, proved counterproductive.
        
        "This president recognizes that there's still a very serious terrorist threat that we face from organizations like Al Qaeda," he said.
        
        "But at the same time, what we have to do is make sure that we're not pouring fuel on the flames by the things that we do."
        
        And so perhaps the biggest change Obama has made is what one former adviser calls the "mood music" -- choice of language, outreach to Muslims, rhetorical fidelity to the rule of law and a shift in tone from the all-or-nothing days of the Bush administration. He is committed to taking aggressive actions to disrupt terrorist cells, aides said, but he also considers his speech in Cairo to the Islamic world in June central to his efforts to combat terrorism.
        
        "If you asked him what are the most important things he's done to fight terrorism in his first year, he would put Cairo in the top three," Rahm Emanuel, his chief of staff, told me.
        
        The policies themselves, though, have not changed nearly as much as the political battles over closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay and trying Khalid Shaikh Mohammed in New York would suggest.
        
        "The administration came in determined to undo a lot of the policies of the prior administration," Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the top Republican on the homeland-security committee, told me, "but in fact is finding that many of those policies were better-thought-out than they realized -- or that doing away with them is a far more complex task."
        
        If terrorism has not been the driving force of the Obama presidency, neither has it been the catalytic issue to the American people that it was more than eight years ago, when the twin towers collapsed in a heap of steel, concrete and bodies. Yet that mood can change in a hurry, as the Christmas Day plot showed. Obama understands that, if only by the law of averages, there is a decent chance of a major attack on the United States during his presidency. And if that attack happens, any change in policy, no matter how incidental to the facts of the case, will be fodder for critics to blame him for the attack. When the aviation screening and intelligence systems that Bush built failed to stop Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a 23-year-old Nigerian with ties to Al Qaeda's branch in Yemen, from getting on a plane bound for Detroit with explosives in his underwear last month, a number of Obama's political opponents blamed the sitting president. If Bush's system was broken, they asked, why didn't Obama fix it?
        
        But the underlying complaint seemed less about any particular policy than about Obama himself -- how he reacted, how he spoke, how he led. Although he held conference calls every day with Brennan, who was back in Washington, it took Obama three days to emerge from his Hawaiian vacation to address the matter in public, and when he did, he was typically cool and cerebral, with none of Bush's bring-it-on, dead-or-alive rhetoric. Never mind that Bush took six days to publicly address the 2001 case of Richard Reid, the shoe bomber, or that Reid was charged in civilian court, not as an enemy combatant; critics like Cheney argued again that Obama did not believe America was at war. Bush felt it in his gut. Obama thinks about it in his head. If he rushed out in public to talk the minute something happened, wouldn't that play into the hands of those trying to instill fear in the American people? Shouldn't he prudently wait for more information? Yet with the country afraid, is it possible to overthink it?
        
        "You've got almost two extremes," Henry Crumpton, who led the C.I.A.'s operation in Afghanistan after Sept. 11 and who later served as counterterrorism chief at the State Department under Bush, told me several weeks before the Christmas Day attempt.
        
        "You've got Bush 43, who aspired to have a warrior's ethos. He was driven, I think, by that, and in some ways it hurt us with the lack of rigor and examination of some of the consequences of our actions, Iraq being the most horrible extreme. Obama comes at it from the other extreme. He comes at it like a lawyer would, someone who may not accept and may even reject this idea of a warrior's ethos. And it is a war. You've got guys out there who want to kill us."
        
        Obama was a state senator in Illinois when the planes smashed into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and an empty field in Pennsylvania. He was driving to a legislative hearing in Chicago when he heard early reports on the radio.
        
        "By the time I arrived at my meeting," he wrote in his book "The Audacity of Hope," "the second plane had already hit, and we were told to evacuate the State of Illinois Building. Up and down the streets, people gathered, staring at the sky and at the Sears Tower. Later, in my law office, a group of us sat motionless as the nightmare images unfolded across the TV screen."
        
        That day instilled in Bush a sense of unwavering purpose, but Obama's support for the pursuit of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan gave way to doubts about the circumvention of legal structures at home and eventually outright opposition to the war in Iraq begun in the name of Sept. 11. As a Harvard Law School graduate who taught constitutional law and spent part of his childhood in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, Obama saw the emerging global struggle through a different lens.
        
        In the spring of 2007, when he was a presidential candidate, Obama met Richard Clarke, the former White House counterterrorism chief who had become one of Bush's sharpest critics on terrorism and national security. The two got together in a run-down apartment a few blocks from the Capitol that Obama used for inconspicuous meetings.
        
        "When I first sat down with him and started going through my standard pitch, he was finishing the sentences," Clarke told me.
        
        "I'd like to think it was because he read my book, but it's a heck of a lot more involved than my book. He'd talked with a lot of people. He'd read a lot about it. And he had a real understanding."
        
        Clarke became his campaign counterterrorism adviser, and Obama decided to give a speech outlining his view of how to combat extremists and how not to. His advisers told him he had a choice: he could try to out-Cheney Cheney and demonstrate that when it comes to national security, Democrats also have hairy chests, as one put it, or he could develop a new paradigm. Obama, typically, found the idea of a new paradigm more appealing, although he threw in a vow to strike terrorists in Pakistan even, if necessary, without permission of its government.
        
        "It is time to turn the page," he declared in the speech he gave in Washington in August 2007. He said that "America is at war with terrorists who killed on our soil; we are not at war with Islam."
        
        He criticized claims of "unchecked presidential power" and vowed "to close Guantanamo, reject the Military Commissions Act and adhere to the Geneva Conventions."
        
        He said "that means no more illegal wiretapping of American citizens, no more national-security letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime" and "no more ignoring the law when it is inconvenient."
        
        By the time he won the presidency more than a year later, he was receiving classified briefings on terrorist networks around the world. The government's top intelligence officials beat a path to Chicago to fill him in. They confronted him with the dark side, as Cheney once put it.
        
        "The risks we are talking about are the things you don't want to talk about around the Thanksgiving table," Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security, told me.
        
        Yet even some of the Bush appointees were ready for change, appealing to Obama to revamp the struggle.
        
        "Mr. President-elect, we're doing things very well, but we're losing the messaging war," Michael Leiter, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, told him a week after the election, according to an official informed about the session. A significant share of the global population thought America was at war against the rest of the world, Leiter maintained.
        
        "You have an opportunity to change that message, to change how the struggle is perceived," he said.
        
        Obama was receptive to that mandate.
        
        "We're going to do that," he replied.
        
        When Obama sat down to talk with the outgoing president, Bush pressed him to be vigilant every day.
        
        "That's mostly what they talked about," a senior Bush adviser told me.
        
        "I think President Bush came away thinking that President Obama understood at an intellectual level, but you don't really understand at a gut level until you're in that seat."
        
        Martha Joynt Kumar, a professor at Towson University who wrote about the inaugural threat in a paper published last month in the journal Presidential Studies Quarterly, said the teamwork between old and new administrations marked one of the smoothest presidential transitions in modern times. Yet for all the cooperation, Obama chose to make one of his first acts a strike against the Bush legacy, signing executive orders drafted by his new White House counsel, Greg Craig, that banned interrogation techniques like waterboarding as torture and ordered the prison at Guantanamo closed within a year. The move generated debate about timing and tactics. John Podesta, who ran Obama's transition, agreed with the policy but argued against making Guantanamo the first priority right after inauguration, according to colleagues. Craig and others countered that it was important to send a signal of change from the start.
        
        Obama also wanted to uproot the resentments and hatred that fuel extremism.
        
        "The language we use matters," he told the Al Arabiya television network a week after taking office. So Obama informally banished the rhetoric of the last administration.
        
        "War on terror" was out; so were "Islamofascism" and "evildoers."
        
        The new language did not always go over well. While testifying to Congress a year ago, Napolitano used the phrase "man-caused disasters," and though she said "terrorism" elsewhere in her remarks, she drew wide scorn. ("I was totally misinterpreted in a sense of what I was trying to communicate," she later told me.
        
        "It was just a mistake. In the editing process, that phrase, usually it's'terrorism or other man-caused disasters.' ")
        
        John Brennan, who has emerged as the administration's public face for counterterrorism policy, is solidly built, with a weathered face and close-cropped, retreating hair. His eyes seem to take your measure when you walk into the room, studying intently as if searching for your ulterior motives. He is friendly and unfailingly polite but does not laugh easily. He is a serious man in a serious business, a career man, a survivor, someone who has navigated the treacherous politics of the intelligence world and vaulted to great heights only to be disappointed. And now he is helping Obama redirect the war against Al Qaeda.
        
        A native of North Bergen, N.J., Brennan, who is 54, attended Catholic schools, all the way through Fordham University. After his freshman year, he went to Indonesia in the summer of 1974 to visit a cousin who was working there, and in the same country that helped shape Obama's worldview, he developed a case of youthful wanderlust. He studied Arabic and played basketball with Egyptians in Cairo before earning a master's degree in Middle East studies at the University of Texas at Austin. While reading The New York Times on a bus one day, he saw a C.I.A. recruitment ad and decided to apply. When I asked why, he gave one of those answers that sounds as if it came from an espionage novel.
        
        "Nathan Hale was hanged on the day of my birth," he said of the nation's first spy.
        
        At the C.I.A., Brennan rose through the ranks, becoming station chief in Saudi Arabia during the late 1990s, a time of rising Islamic terrorism. Just months before he arrived in Riyadh, terrorists blew up the Khobar Towers apartment complex, killing 19 American service members. During his tour, they also attacked American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya. A favorite of George J. Tenet, the C.I.A. director first appointed by President Bill Clinton and later retained by Bush, Brennan would become Tenet's chief of staff and later the agency's deputy executive director.
        
        After Sept. 11, Brennan helped set up the Terrorist Threat Integration Center and served as its first and only director. But his steady rise reached a peak. When the center was refashioned as the National Counterterrorism Center, bringing together experts across the government to coordinate the war on terror, he served as interim director but was never given the permanent job. Brennan, unhappy, left government in 2005 and went on to write a proposed op-ed essay that he titled, "Mr. President, You're Wrong on Iraq."
        
        In keeping with C.I.A. rules, he submitted it for classification review by the agency before distributing it to any newspapers for publication. A copy found its way to the White House, where it angered top officials. Brennan ultimately thought better of the article and withdrew it from C.I.A. review, but it was too late to salvage his standing at the White House.
        
        "He was dead to them," says a friend and fellow senior official, who did not want to be named discussing internal matters. An attempt to later make him deputy director of national intelligence was killed by the White House. Obama presented another chance.
        
        "This is redemption," the friend said.
        
        Anthony Lake, a former national security adviser who knew Brennan from his days as a C.I.A. briefer in the Clinton White House, was working for Obama's nascent presidential campaign and brought in the former intelligence officer to advise the candidate in 2007. Obama grew to like Brennan's precise, matter-of-fact style so much that after the election he considered making him the C.I.A. director. But the idea of appointing Tenet's right-hand man, a C.I.A. careerist who was at the center of the Bush war on terror, rankled Obama supporters on the left.
        
        Stephen Soldz, a psychologist at the Boston Graduate School of Psychoanalysis and a leader of the Coalition for an Ethical Psychology, circulated a letter of opposition to Brennan signed by 200 other psychologists. The letter cited an interview Brennan gave in 2006 to PBS's "Frontline," in which he said Tenet's concern in devising the Bush-era interrogation program was making sure it was on sound legal footing.
        
        "We know, of course, that'the appropriate Department of Justice review' means that torture was authorized and conducted by our government," Soldz's letter said.
        
        But the letter did not quote the rest of what Brennan said in that interview as he grappled with the morality of the government's actions.
        
        "There was a real debate within the agency, including today, about what are the minimum standards that you want to stoop to and beyond where you're not going to go, because we don't want to stoop to using the same types of standards that terrorists use," he told PBS.
        
        "We are in this business, whether it be intelligence or the government, to protect freedom, democracy and liberty, not to violate that."
        
        Still, human rights advocates have a point about continuity. For all his talk of change, Obama has kept a lot of veterans of the Bush administration in place. Besides Brennan, there is Gates still atop the Pentagon, as well as Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff appointed by Bush, and Michael Vickers, still the assistant Defense secretary for special operations. While Obama tapped Leon Panetta to take over the C.I.A., he kept the deputy director, Stephen Kappes, along with Leiter, the head of the National Counterterrorism Center. Obama fired the top general in Afghanistan, but the head of the regional military command overseeing both Afghanistan and Iraq remains Bush's favorite officer, Gen. David Petraeus, and the White House coordinator for Afghanistan and Pakistan is Bush's Iraq war czar, Lt. Gen. Douglas Lute. To manage the effort to close Guantanamo, Obama named one of Bush's assistant secretaries of state, Daniel Fried. The Treasury under secretary chasing terrorist financing is still Stuart Levey, and the National Security Council's senior director for combating terrorism is still Nick Rasmussen.
        
        Most of those people, of course, were in the moderate camp inside the Bush administration, not the Cheney cadre, or like Brennan they present themselves as simply career professionals who followed orders or who even quietly dissented from the most extreme policies of the last eight years.
        
        "I was somebody who did oppose waterboarding," Brennan told me.
        
        "I opposed different aspects of the enhanced interrogation program. But there were some aspects of it that I concurred with."
        
        For instance, he offered, "if you grab somebody by the lapels, and you say, Oh, my goodness, you've violated their rights as a person, well, I'm not going to go that far."
        
        Time and circumstances have changed as well.
        
        "Four years ago, I would have said -- and I did say -- the agency's detention program needed to continue," Brennan said, referring to the secret "black site" overseas prisons ran by the C.I.A.
        
        "There have been a lot of developments and changes, so the things I might have advocated three or four years ago, because of the changed conditions, because of a new administration, whatever, I wouldn't necessarily advocate them now at all. I've changed my views."
        
        Soldz told me he has been pleased that Brennan has said the right things since taking the White House job. But Obama's refusal to completely repudiate the Bush-era policies bothers Soldz.
        
        "I wake up some mornings disgusted by Obama," he said.
        
        "And then I think about it some more and understand the pressure he's under. So I'm having these battles inside myself."
        
        Several weeks after Obama took office, I sat down with the president, along with three colleagues from The Times, in his conference room on Air Force One during a flight back from an event in Ohio. Now that he was in office, we asked what, if anything, he had come to believe that Bush had gotten right in the balance between security and civil liberties.
        
        The candidate who denounced the "color-coded politics of fear" and rejected policies that "compromised our most precious values" was now a commander in chief wrestling with how to protect those values and the country at the same time. He told us that many of the worst practices he had objected to had already been corrected by the end of Bush's presidency.
        
        "I would distinguish between some of the steps that were taken immediately after 9/11 and where we were by the time I took office," he told us.
        
        "I think the C.I.A., for example, and some of the controversial programs that have been a focus of a lot of attention, took steps to correct certain policies and procedures after those first couple of years."
        
        The battle with terrorists evolved significantly over the course of the Bush presidency, and when Obama took office, the course he set was more about accelerating that evolution than about restarting it. Under pressure from Supreme Court rulings, Congressional legislation and disclosures in the news media, Bush in his second term trimmed back some of his most expansive programs and claims to executive power. Two years before leaving office, he told advisers he wanted to use his remaining time to institutionalize what was left so that his successor, even a Democrat, would not feel compelled to reverse direction.
        
        By the time Obama was inaugurated, waterboarding had been halted for years, Bush had ordered that the secret C.I.A. black site prisons be emptied and the warrantless surveillance program and the military commission system had been restructured and approved by Congress. Bush had even declared that he wanted to close the Guantanamo prison, and although he never managed to do so, his team released or transferred about 500 detainees as a first step.
        
        Obama built on those actions. While setting a one-year deadline to close Guantanamo and formally banning the interrogation methods that had already fallen out of favor, he left the surveillance program intact, embraced the Patriot Act, retained the authority to use renditions and embraced some of Bush's claims to state secrets. He preserved the military commissions and national security letters he criticized during the campaign, albeit with more due-process safeguards. He plans to hold dozens of suspected terrorists without charges indefinitely. And he expanded Bush's campaign of unmanned drone strikes against Al Qaeda in the tribal areas of Pakistan. Troop levels in Afghanistan are set to triple on his watch.
        
        A half-dozen former senior Bush officials involved in counterterrorism told me before the Christmas Day incident that for the most part, they were comfortable with Obama's policies, although they were reluctant to say so on the record. Some worried they would draw the ire of Cheney's circle if they did, while others calculated that calling attention to the similarities to Bush would only make it harder for Obama to stay the course. And they generally resent Obama's anti-Bush rhetoric and are unwilling to give him political cover by defending him.
        
        Michael Hayden, the last C.I.A. director under Bush, was willing to say publicly what others would not.
        
        "There is a continuum from the Bush administration, particularly as it changed in the second administration as circumstances changed, and the Obama administration," Hayden told me. James Jay Carafano, a homeland-security expert at the Heritage Foundation, was blunter.
        
        "I don't think it's even fair to call it Bush Lite," he said.
        
        "It's Bush. It's really, really hard to find a difference that's meaningful and not atmospheric. You see a lot of straining on things trying to make things look repackaged, but they're really not that different."
        
        Not every Bush veteran agrees, of course. Marc Thiessen, a former White House speechwriter, has a new book called, "Courting Disaster: How the C.I.A. Kept America Safe and How Barack Obama Is Inviting the Next Attack."
        
        Tom Ridge, the former homeland security secretary, told me before the Christmas Day plot that under Obama, Washington had "lost a certain sense of urgency and commitment to combating terrorism."
        
        Most disturbing to the Bush camp, even to those who generally see continuity in Obama's policies, have been Attorney General Eric Holder's decisions to release legal memos that described interrogation techniques used by the C.I.A., to reinvestigate allegations of interrogation abuse by C.I.A. officers and to take Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the self-declared mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, to New York to face trial in civilian court. Hayden recalled warning Jim Jones, Obama's national security adviser, last spring not to alienate the C.I.A. by dredging up the past.
        
        "You're about to spend the next 46 months without a clandestine service," Hayden recalled saying.
        
        "If these guys don't think you have their back, they're not going to be very adventurous."
        
        There is ample historical precedent for this cycle. During times of national crisis, Washington often claims more authority, sometimes to the point of excess, then slowly cedes it back, from the Sedition Act signed by John Adams to Abraham Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus during the Civil War to Franklin D. Roosevelt's internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II -- all cases in which the system eventually corrected itself in one fashion or another.
        
        "Historically the more we move away from a crisis, the better we're able to see the costs and benefits of what we're doing, and we go from being extremely risk-averse to finding a better balance," says Geoffrey Stone, a professor and former dean at the University of Chicago law school.
        
        Bush says he sees another historical pattern. In private discussions with associates during the 2008 presidential campaign, he predicted that if a Democrat won, he or she would be like Dwight Eisenhower to his Harry Truman. Just as Eisenhower on the campaign trail criticized Truman's policies in the early years of the cold war only to essentially adopt them after taking office, Bush anticipated that his successor would preserve most of what he had put in place. Of course, this conveniently fits into Bush's hope that, like Truman, he will look better in the eyes of history. A senior Obama adviser scoffed at the idea that Bush advisers see continuity, arguing that they are trying to launder their reputations by claiming validation. But it is true that much of the Bush security architecture is almost certain to remain part of the national fabric for some time to come, thanks to Obama.
        
        Stone, who helped bring Obama to the University of Chicago law school, says his former colleague must be wary of doing anything that would increase the risk of a terrorist attack against the United States.
        
        "He may feel in fact," Stone says, "that it's a more dangerous world than he thought it was, that some of these measures may be more necessary than he thought."
        
        Stone joined a group of human-rights and civil-liberties advocates at the White House last spring for a meeting with Obama to talk about issues of interrogation and detention. Obama had struggled through a rocky few months trying to find the balance between security and liberty, arguing that America did not need to sacrifice one for the other.
        
        The decision to close the Guantanamo prison sparked a revolt in Congress, even among Democrats who worried about suspected terrorists being transferred to prisons in their states. An attempt to release into the United States 17 Chinese Uighurs who were deemed no threat to Americans collapsed. Obama authorized the release of the memos detailing the use of waterboarding and other techniques now banned, but he refused to release photographs showing abuse of detainees.
        
        For Brennan, these issues were a chance to get right what he thought went wrong under Bush. But he has found himself at odds with other advisers at times. When Craig and Holder wanted to release the memos about C.I.A. interrogation methods, Brennan initially agreed, reasoning that the tactics in the memos had by then been banned anyway. But he later reversed himself and sided with the C.I.A., which argued that the memos would give terrorists too much information about how American interrogators work. Brennan likewise stood with Gates and military leaders who argued that releasing photographs of the abuses would inflame radicals and endanger American troops. Gen. Ray Odierno, the top commander in Iraq, made a personal appeal to Obama during a visit to Washington, and the president agreed to reject Craig's recommendation. Brennan also found an ally at times in Rahm Emanuel, who was said to think that the politics of these decisions were being mishandled and that fights over detention policy used up political capital better spent on priorities like health care and the economy.
        
        By the time he sat down with the human rights advocates in the Cabinet Room, Obama was preparing to make a speech at the National Archives about such issues. Everyone in the room raised hard questions, voicing the disappointment of Obama's strongest supporters. Perhaps the most dramatic appeal came from Anthony Romero, executive director of the A.C.L.U.
        
        "Look, you're the only politician I've ever believed in," Romero said, according to people in the room.
        
        "When I was a gay Puerto Rican growing up in New York, I never thought I could identify with a political leader the way I identify with you. But this stuff really pains me."
        
        Obama pushed back, explaining the constraints he was under. It was a balancing act, he said; he had multiple obligations. Much of the discussion concerned the military commissions he decided to keep and the dilemma of what to do with the hardest cases at Guantanamo, those who could not be prosecuted because of tainted evidence or other reasons but were deemed too dangerous to release.
        
        "He wasn't entirely comfortable with any of the options," says Tom Malinowski, the Washington advocacy director of Human Rights Watch.
        
        When I talked with Romero later, he would not describe his interaction with Obama, but he expressed his frustration. While relieved that the new president seems more open to rethinking Bush-era policies, Romero said he suspected Obama suffers from the "hubris" of wanting to preserve much of the power he inherited in the belief that he will use it more wisely.
        
        "He believes he can do it better and smarter and more in keeping with constitutional principles than his predecessor did," Romero told me.
        
        "If he's shown himself willing to adhere to some of the Bush policies in the absence of an attack, one worries about what he'll do when an attack comes."
        
        The activists left the meeting chilled that Obama seemed poised to continue holding terrorism suspects indefinitely without charges. Just a few years earlier, he wrote in his book that "when we detain suspects indefinitely without trial," then "we weaken our ability to pressure for human rights and the rule of law in despotic regimes."
        
        Now he was talking about seeking legislation that would permanently authorize such preventive detention. Romero and the A.C.L.U. began preparing a campaign against the proposed legislation if he went forward, soliciting letters from international figures like Desmond Tutu, trying to recruit Jimmy Carter and contacting law-school academics. But then the administration reversed course; while it would continue to hold indefinitely without charges perhaps 50 detainees left from the Bush era, it would not enshrine the power in law, and signaled that it would not use it for future cases.
        
        "We were gearing up for the battle of our lives," Romero said.
        
        "Fortunately, they turned back from the abyss."
        
        Liberals were also cheered by a speech Brennan gave in Washington over the summer at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Brennan said Obama "is bringing a fundamentally new and more effective approach," one that would be more "multidimensional" without letting terrorism define American foreign policy. Among other things, he emphasized the "upstream factors," meaning the conditions that fuel extremism, and vowed to promote "a political, economic and social campaign to meet the basic needs and legitimate grievances of ordinary people -- security for their communities, education for children, a job and income for parents and a sense of dignity and worth."
        
        But something else was happening inside the White House. Some in the West Wing, like Emanuel, worried about the collateral cost of Holder's decision that would take Khalid Shaikh Mohammed to New York. Those concerns were relayed to the Justice Department, but Obama declined to intervene and let Holder make the call. Still, by the end of the year, the activists' favorite ally in the West Wing, Greg Craig, was out. He resigned after months of battles over the best way to reorient the war on terror, some that he won and others that he lost.
        
        "He was the one voice for a constant application of the rule of law in the White House," Romero lamented.
        
        "The others either demur or mumble."
        
        Craig's ouster, he added, was "unfortunate because it means the likes of Rahm Emanuel will consolidate power in the White House."
        
        At the house that John Brennan built, about 600 government employees keep tabs on what the extremists are up to, at least as much as they can. The National Counterterrorism Center, which Brennan set up on a leafy campus overlooking the Capital Beltway in the Virginia suburbs outside Washington, is the center of the nation's efforts to hunt down Al Qaeda and its cousins. Obama came to visit last fall, and Brennan accompanied him.
        
        The operations center at the NCTC looks a lot like the set from "24," the Fox television show, with dozens of analysts from an alphabet soup of agencies known by their acronyms -- C.I.A., F.B.I., D.O.D., N.S.A., D.I.A., D.H.S., D.N.I., T.S.A. and so on -- sitting together as they sift through surveillance videos, intercepted telephone calls, satellite imagery, reports from the field, news accounts and myriad other "intelligence streams," as they are known. A dozen large flat-screen televisions tune in everything from satellite reconnaissance to CNN. Digital clocks indicate the time in hot spots around the world. Multiscreen computers help collate vast quantities of information.
        
        This place was supposed to help stop the attack by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab aboard a plane over Detroit on Christmas Day. Since Sept. 11, NCTC and various government agencies have connected the dots repeatedly to head off terrorist attacks. In the last few months alone, the government has arrested a number of suspected plotters in the United States. But the cliche is right -- the government has to be right 100 percent of the time, while the other side needs to succeed only once. And the system failed to pull together what its component parts knew about Abdulmutallab before he boarded Northwest Flight 253 in Amsterdam last month.
        
        The Christmas Day plot touched off a new round of questions among Obama's critics about whether the president is enough of a warrior for the fight against Islamic terrorism. But he has spent much of his time in office killing suspected extremists. With information processed at NCTC and elsewhere, Obama has authorized the C.I.A. to greatly expand a program inherited from Bush using unmanned Predator and Reaper drones to launch missiles at suspected Al Qaeda hideouts along the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Critics complain that such "targeted assassinations" are morally suspect and strategically dangerous because of the reaction among Pakistanis when civilians are killed. Obama had a searching conversation with Brennan and Denis McDonough, Catholics who oppose the death penalty, about whether to keep the program.
        
        "He was wrestling with it," says one adviser. But in the end, there was no serious disagreement with the decision to continue the program. At one of his first Situation Room meetings as president, according to a participant, Obama said pointedly, "The C.I.A. gets what it needs."
        
        The C.I.A. has launched 53 such strikes in Obama's first year in office, more than during Bush's entire presidency, according to data compiled by Peter Bergen and Katherine Tiedemann at the New America Foundation. In part, that strategy owes to increasingly precise technology that has made it easier in the last couple of years to hit a desired target with fewer civilian casualties. And in part, it underscores the ability to redirect resources away from Iraq now that the war has subsided there; when the Obama administration came into office, it learned that dozens of drones were devoted to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan but just five or six in the tribal areas of Pakistan where Al Qaeda's leadership is mainly holed up, according to officials who declined to be identified discussing a classified program. Obama has authorized doubling the number of drones in the Pakistani border area, as well as increasing the presence over Yemen and Somalia, officials said.
        
        Over the course of Obama's first year in office, his drones have taken out a number of "high-value targets," including Baitullah Mehsud, leader of the Pakistani Taliban; Saad bin Laden, a son of Osama bin Laden; and Tahir Yuldashev, leader of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, a close ally of Al Qaeda. At the same time, according to estimates by Bergen and Tiedemann, the civilian death rate of those killed by drone strikes has fallen to about 24 percent in 2009 from about 40 percent from 2006 to 2008. Government officials insist that the civilian casualty rate is even lower.
        
        "I don't hear anyone inside the government, including people like me who came from outside, who thinks the Predator program is anything but essential," says a senior Obama counterterrorism official.
        
        "There are a lot of negatives, but it is completely essential."
        
        Obama has been willing to be muscular in other ways as well. When intelligence agencies concluded in September that they had found Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, an Al Qaeda operative linked to the 2002 bombing of a Kenyan hotel, in southern Somalia, officials debated three options, including one to insert American special-operations forces in that lawless East African country, several officials told me. Obama's advisers rejected that and presented him instead with a plan for an airstrike, which he approved. Weather on the day of the strike prompted a change in plans, and commanders instead authorized attack helicopters to sweep into Somalia. Nabhan was killed. American forces landed afterward to collect bodies and evidence.
        
        Most salient at the moment is Obama's focus on Yemen, the poor, unstable state south of Saudi Arabia where Osama bin Laden's family hailed from. Yemen in many ways is where Obama's two wars come together. It is a breeding ground for extremism, the home of the radical cleric who inspired Maj. Nidal Hasan before he opened fire at Fort Hood last fall and, the president has stated, the origin of the Christmas Day bombing plot involving Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab. At the same time, it is the place where roughly half of the remaining detainees at Guantanamo come from, making it the central focus for efforts to close the prison.
        
        Brennan visited Yemen in March and again in September to focus new energy on combating Al Qaeda there. Obama has ordered more training, equipment and intelligence sharing for the Yemeni government; about $70 million was set aside to bulk up Yemeni forces, doubling previous spending, and last week the administration announced it would double it again next year. Last month the American government also provided intelligence and hardware for Yemeni airstrikes on suspected Al Qaeda hideouts. Brennan has also been trying to set up a rehabilitation program for Yemen like the one in Saudi Arabia that American officials say they believe has been largely successful in transitioning former Guantanamo detainees back into society -- although some have joined up with Al Qaeda nonetheless. And by the time Brennan returned from his most recent trip, many of his colleagues had despaired of ever finding a safe way to repatriate the nearly 100 Yemenis still at Guantanamo. That was before Detroit.
        
        Obama was singing Christmas carols with his family at a house in Hawaii when a military aide arrived to tell him that someone tried to blow up a plane over Detroit. The president got on the phone with Brennan, who told him a Nigerian man tried to ignite chemicals secreted in his underwear, only to have passengers and crew jump him. Soon enough, Abdulmutallab would be tied to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which operates in Yemen.
        
        Notwithstanding Janet Napolitano's statement last month that "the system worked," Obama suspected that it had not. While on vacation he was given an 80-page review of the Fort Hood shooting, looking at how information about Hasan was not well circulated within the federal government. The night after his first statement, his advisers learned that the government possessed National Security Agency-intercepted conversations that could have helped to stop Abdulmutallab if they had been shared widely.
        
        Obama talked with Brennan and other advisers by phone the next morning. He was simmering.
        
        "Let me make this very clear to you," he told the advisers, according to two of them.
        
        "While I understand intelligence is hard, and I'll never fault anybody for not having full intelligence, what I will fault is when we have full intelligence that's not shared."
        
        After hanging up with Brennan, aides scrambled to organize a statement to the news media. Denis McDonough, the National Security Council chief of staff, typed out a draft on the president's laptop as Obama hovered over his shoulder.
        
        "What's the deal?" Obama asked.
        
        "I'm just about done," McDonough said.
        
        "Well, just move over."
        
        Obama sat down and finished it himself.
        
        The president's statement that there was a "systemic failure" did not quell the political furor, and White House officials were caught off guard by the intensity of the criticism. After reading a Cheney statement that attacked Obama for only pretending to be at war with terrorists, David Axelrod angrily wrote a long statement trashing the former vice president and gave it to Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director, who revised it and posted on the White House Web site. The criticism got Brennan's back up too, particularly coming from some of his former colleagues in the Bush administration.
        
        "A lot of the knuckleheads I've been listening to out there on the network shows don't know what they're talking about," he told me after the Christmas Day attempt. Some Republicans, including Cheney, were blatantly mischaracterizing the record, he fumed.
        
        "When they say the administration's not at war with Al Qaeda, that is just complete hogwash."
        
        It was the angriest I had heard him during months of conversations.
        
        "What they're doing is just playing into Al Qaeda's strategic effort, which is to get us to battle among ourselves instead of focusing on them," he said.
        
        It is moments like these when Brennan's disaffection from the last administration becomes evident.
        
        "I much prefer talking with someone who is interested in understanding the situation and responding to it appropriately," Brennan told me.
        
        For all of the attention on the Nigerian underwear bomber, some experts say they believe the more insidious threat will be a new generation of homegrown extremists. In recent months, authorities have arrested a number of American residents, including Najibullah Zazi, an airport-shuttle driver who is suspected of plotting to attack New York after receiving training in Pakistan, and David Coleman Headley, a Pakistani-American accused of aiding terrorist attacks in Mumbai. There was the Fort Hood shooting rampage, as well as a group of Somali-Americans from Minnesota who reportedly wanted to fight in Somalia and five American Muslims from Virginia who traveled to Pakistan supposedly to join the jihad.
        
        If they are the next wave, American extremists are going to be hard to track and stop. The Internet makes it possible for Al Qaeda and its allies to reach out from the dusty villages of Waziristan all the way to Illinois and Colorado.
        
        "Although no one wants to admit it, I think a watershed has been crossed in the terrorist threat in the United States," Bruce Hoffman, a Georgetown University terrorism scholar, told me.
        
        "It's way different than it was in the Bush years."
        
        The Obama administration has been trying to figure out how to counter it. In October, Obama secretly ordered a review of the ways different agencies track travels between the United States and places like Pakistan to look for holes to close. Napolitano told me: "We can't operate in the paradigm that if they attack us, they would be coming from other countries into the United States. We have some that are homegrown. That is a change."
        
        After all the lawyerly focus on Guantanamo and the rules of war, the latest threats put more focus on Obama in the role of commander in chief. It did not go unnoticed that when he accepted the Nobel Peace Prize last month, he declared that "evil does exist in the world."
        
        His press secretary, Robert Gibbs, went on the Sunday shows after the Christmas Day plot and, consciously or not, used the term "war on terror."
        
        The White House then dispatched Brennan for a blitz of four Sunday shows, the first such foray for the C.I.A. veteran. In his first radio and Internet address of the new year, Obama implicitly rebutted Cheney by noting that he used the word "war" is his inaugural address.
        
        "Our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred," Obama said.
        
        The war goes on, abroad and at home.

    textlede: Yemen kills militants behind embassy threats
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Yemeni forces on Monday killed at least two al-Qaida militants they said were behind a threat that forced the U.S. and European embassies to close, as concern grew about the poor Arab country's stability.
        
        The raid took place after the attempted bombing of a U.S.-bound plane on Christmas Day thrust Yemen into the foreground of the U.S.-led war against Islamist militants.
        
        U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said fighting in Yemen was a threat to regional and global stability.
        
        "We see global implications from the war in Yemen and the ongoing efforts by al-Qaida in Yemen to use it as a base for terrorist attacks far beyond the region," she said.
        
        The western nations and Saudi Arabia fear al-Qaida will take advantage of Yemen's instability to spread its operations to the neighbouring kingdom, the world's biggest oil exporter, and beyond. Yemen itself produces a small amount of oil.
        
        A Yemeni security official told Reuters militants targeted in Monday's raid were behind the threats to the U.S. embassy.
        
        "Security authorities had been monitoring them for several days and struck today," he said.
        
        Agents were hunting Mohammed al-Haniq, a local al-Qaida leader, but he was able to get away, state media reported.
        
        The U.S. embassy in Sanaa stayed shut for a second day in response to what it said was al-Qaida threats. Britain's embassy has also been closed since Sunday.
        
        Other European countries, including France and Italy, limited access to their embassies on Monday, as did Japan.
        
        The Dutch Foreign Ministry said it had temporarily closed the consular and visa sections of its embassy.
        
        A Yemeni security official denied a BBC report that six trucks belonging to the security forces and loaded with arms and explosives had gone missing.
        
        Security has been high in a residential area of Sanaa that houses several embassies since before the latest threats, with army vehicles blocking several streets.
        
        Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), the regional wing of Osama bin Laden's network, said it was behind the Dec. 25 attempt to blow up a U.S. passenger plane carrying 300 people from Amsterdam to Detroit.
        
        It said the attempt was in retaliation for U.S. involvement in Yemen and its support for the government's offensive against the militants. AQAP also called last month for attacks on embassies, military bases and "fleets in the waters of the Arabian Peninsula and the surrounding territory."
        
        Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh said on Monday that Yemen was "ready to confront and defeat anyone thinking of harming the country and its security," state media said.
        
        U.S. President Barack Obama has said it was a priority to help the Yemeni government strike at al-Qaida.
        
        Gen. David Petraeus, head of U.S. Central Command, said last week the United States would more than double its $70-million security assistance for Yemen. The Pentagon on Monday cautioned that no decision had been made.

    textlede: 4 western embassies shut doors in Yemen; Three restrict public access
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        The U.S. and Britain shut their embassies in Yemen for a second day, citing security threats, and Yemeni security forces killed two suspected al-Qaida militants near the capital.
        
        A third militant was injured and detained, said a government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.
        
        France and the Czech Republic also shut their embassies, while Spain, Germany and Japan announced restrictions on public access to their missions.
        
        Yemen has been emerging as a base for al-Qaida as the group comes under pressure in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The Yemen branch of al-Qaida claimed responsibility for a Dec. 25 bomb plot in which Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was charged in the U.S. with trying to blow up a Northwest Airlines flight with 278 passengers as it landed in Detroit.
        
        The U.S. Embassy in Sana'a was closed "in response to ongoing threats by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula to attack American interests in Yemen," the embassy said on its website Monday. An official at the British Embassy, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed the closure of his embassy.
        
        Yemen is struggling to subdue an insurgency by northern Shiite Muslim rebels that has drawn in neighbouring Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally, and a secessionist movement in the south.
        
        Yemen is the poorest Arab nation and the government expects oil reserves that fund 70 per cent of the budget to run out over the next decade.
        
        Fears of terrorist strikes against western embassies grew on Monday with claims that trucks laden with explosives had been smuggled into Sana'a.
        
        Militants driving six trucks filled with weapons and ordnance are thought to have entered the city, officials said.
        
        The identity of those who smuggled the weapons consignment into Sana'a has not been disclosed, and it is unclear whether they are linked to al-Qaida's powerful Yemeni branch.
        
        Although an AQAP statement on Sunday urged its followers to kill all western diplomats on the Arab Peninsula, western officials have not divulged whether specific threats have been made.
        
        Diplomats dismissed speculation that the vanishing convoy could presage an imminent attack on western interests in the city.
        
        "These reports have nothing to do with the reason embassies were shut," one said.
        
        A combination of corruption, poverty and lawlessness has helped turn Yemen into fertile breeding ground for al-Qaida. Some observers have said the country could emerge as a "new Afghanistan" and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown on the weekend warned that Yemen was becoming a "failing state."
        
        Meanwhile, the U.S. overhauled its terror watch, putting dozens more suspects on "no-fly" lists.
        
        "There's already been a rescrubbing of all the different lists," White House spokesman Bill Burton said, referring to the lists that determine whether a person is allowed to board a U.S.-bound flight in a foreign airport.
        
        "Probably thousands upon thousands upon thousands of names were scrubbed, and probably dozens were moved to different lists," he said of the reviews carried out in the wake of Christmas Day bombing attempt.

    textlede: International: Terrorism: Al-Qaida alert forces UK to close Yemen embassy: US also closes mission after 'specific intelligence': White House adviser threatens military action
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Britain and the US closed their embassies in Yemen yesterday because of fears of an imminent terror attack by the local wing of al-Qaida blamed for the failed attempt to blow up an airliner on Christmas Day.
        
        Officials in London and Washington said the decision to close the missions was a result of specific intelligence. John Brennan, the US counterterrorism chief, said the American embassy, which was attacked twice in 2008, was shut because of "indications al-Qaida is planning to carry out an attack against a target inside of Sana'a (the capital) - possibly our embassy.We're not going to take any chances with the lives of embassy personnel," he said.
        
        Referring to al-Qaida, he said the US would do "everything to hold these individuals accountable". Asked whether that meant possible military action in Yemen, he replied: "Everything is possible."
        
        The Foreign Office said a decision on whether to reopen the British mission would be made this morning. Spain also said it was restricting access to its Sana'a embassy.
        
        The embassy closure came a day after the top US commander for the Middle East, General David Petraeus, visited Yemen to pledge support from Barack Obama for the government's campaign against al-Qaida and a doubling of America's $67m (£41.5m) counterterrorism assistance.
        
        Gordon Brown told the BBC yesterday that "we've got to do more" to combat terrorism in Yemen, and called for a conference in London at the end of the month to discuss what more the international community could do to contain the growing al-Qaida threat from there.
        
        Brown also said Britain would step up its own support for counter-terrorist units and Yemeni coastguard operations, but Downing Street later said the money would be allocated from within the existing Yemen aid budget.
        
        The US has been training Yemeni counterterrorist forces for several years, and Petraeus said that support would be doubled.
        
        But experts on the region said without more help Yemen risked becoming a failed state, similar to Somalia. Ginny Hill, a specialist on Yemen at the Chatham House thinktank, said the attacks were "a symptom of a much deeper underlying problem, the collapse of the state system".
        
        She said Yemen was reliant on oil revenues which are expected to dwindle to nothing over the next decade.
        
        "It's not as if you're starting at a static position, you're working on a downward trajectory," she said.
        
        Over the weekend, Barack Obama named al-Qaida in the Arabian peninsula as the group behind the Christmas Day attempt to bomb a commercial airliner landing in Detroit, by a 23-year-old Nigerian, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab. Claiming responsibility last week, the al-Qaida affiliate urged Muslims to "killing every crusader who works at their embassies or other places".
        
        Amid the heightened al-Qaida threat against western targets, several international aid and development agencies working in Yemen have begun to restrict their operations and tighten security.
        
        Andrew Moore, British director of Save the Children in Yemen, said his agency had pulled out all foreign staff from their office in Abyan, scene of a US-backed air strike on 17 December aimed at al-Qaida leaders, but which local sources said killed as many as 50 people, including women and children.
        
        Both American and British embassies have been targeted in recent years. In 2008, 19 people were killed by a bomb attack on the US embassy while an al-Qaida plot to bomb the British mission was foiled three years earlier.
        
        Since then, security has been stepped up dramatically. Perched on a hill in northern San'a, the British embassy is surrounded by blast walls, security cameras and razor wire, while its main buildings are dug deep into the hillside, meaning key offices are underground.
        
        A few miles away, the US embassy is also heavily guarded, set back from the main road and surrounded by heavily fortified checkpoints with blast walls, ramps and several layers of heavily armed security.
        
        Yemen deployed several hundred extra soldiers to two mountainous eastern provinces yesterday that are al-Qaida's main strongholds in the country. But Ali Seif Hassan, director of the Political Development Forum thinktank in San'a, said a military approach alone would fail to defeat al-Qaida.
        
        "This is a war that will be won on intelligence gathered in co-ordination with the international community," he said.
        
        He said the stakes for the Yemeni authorities in their war against al-Qaida could not be higher, but warned against the deployment of international troops to the country.
        
        "Yemen will win this war. There is no other option, or we lose the state as in Somalia. But the difference between winning and losing the war will be the presence of foreign soldiers. If foreign troops are deployed in an actual and visible way all the tribes and people will fight against them," he said.
        
        Gregory Johnsen, an expert on Yemen at Princeton University, said American involvement could extend to carrying out military strikes itself. But he warned "Al-Qaida in Yemen is far too entrenched and strong for a military miracle to work".

    textlede: A lost victory in the terror war
    textcmt:

        The F.B.I. unraveled an entire Al Qaeda network in Yemen, only to see it rise again.
        
        FULL TEXT
        
        The evidence that Al Qaeda's branch in Yemen had a role in the failed Christmas Day bombing of an American passenger jet has led some to declare that Yemen is the new front in the war against the terrorist organization. But the truth is, Yemen has been a front in that war since at least Oct. 12, 2000, when Al Qaeda blew up the U.S. Navy destroyer Cole, killing 17 American sailors, in the port of Aden. The explosives for the bombing were bought in Yemen. And the attackers and their accomplices were predominantly Yemenis. Indeed, after the attack, terrorists in Qaeda camps in Afghanistan would march and chant, "We, the Yemenis, destroyed the Cole."
        
        As the F.B.I. case agent for the Cole investigation from 2000 to 2005, I spent years with colleagues in Yemen hunting down those responsible, and we unraveled an entire Qaeda network in the country.
        
        Even before the Cole attack, Yemen was linked to terrorist acts. Most of the people who executed the 1998 East African embassy bombings either traveled through Yemen or used fraudulent Yemeni passports. Almost two years after the Cole, Qaeda terrorists based in Yemen struck the Limburg, a French oil tanker, off the coast of Yemen. Qaeda terrorists in Yemen also helped facilitate the attacks of 9/11. Fahd al-Quso, a Yemeni Qaeda member who confessed to me his role in the Cole bombing, also admitted to ferrying money to a Qaeda operative known as Khallad who was part of an important 9/11 planning meeting in Malaysia.
        
        As recently as this past August, an assassination attempt against Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, Saudi Arabia's deputy minister of interior in charge of security, was plotted in Yemen. The explosive mixture that the suicide bomber used in that attack was the same one that Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab tried to ignite on the passenger jet over Detroit - and in each case the terrorist hid the mixture in his underwear.
        
        Yemen is a very appealing base for Al Qaeda. The country has convenient access to Al Qaeda's main theaters of battle, including Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan. Its borders are unsecured, and tribal groups sympathetic to Al Qaeda control many regions, so terrorists can move freely into, out of and around the country. And guns and explosives are readily available.
        
        The country's tribal nature also makes it a relatively easy place for Al Qaeda to operate. Yemen has a weak government and powerful regional tribes, which in many ways operate as mini-governments free of central control. In addition, the government is struggling to contain both a secessionist movement in the south and a rebellion in the north. Rampant poverty and illiteracy make it easy for Al Qaeda to manipulate Yemenis into believing its propaganda.
        
        When I was in Yemen, I found many extremely capable officials in law enforcement and intelligence who were dedicated to stopping Al Qaeda. With their help, and with support from American intelligence and military agencies, our F.B.I. team was able to arrest and prosecute in a Yemeni court people responsible for the Cole bombing and for planning other attacks. By the time we left Yemen, in 2005, those terrorists were in prison.
        
        Later, however, some of them "escaped," and others were given clemency. Jamal al-Badawi, for example, a Qaeda terrorist who confessed to me his role in the Cole bombing, was sentenced to death by a Yemeni judge in 2004. But in 2006, he "escaped," only to turn himself in the next year - in a deal that released him from prison on a promise of good behavior. Today, Mr. Quso, the confessed Cole bomber, is not only free, he's giving interviews and re-establishing himself as a terrorist operative.
        
        During the past year, in an ominous sign of Yemen's rising importance to Al Qaeda, the Saudi branch of the organization merged with the Yemeni branch to form a single terrorist group known as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. It is based in Yemen and headed by a Yemeni, Naser Abdel-Karim al-Wahishi, who served as a close aide to Osama bin Laden. Mr. Wahishi "escaped" from jail with Mr. Badawi.
        
        Some Yemeni government officials highly value their relationship with the United States, which provides financial aid and military training. During our investigation of the Cole bombing, when the American government made it clear to the Yemenis that they expected full cooperation, the Yemenis who were dedicated to justice were given free rein and those with extremist ties were sidelined. After the trials were over and the terrorists made it out of jail, Robert S. Mueller III, the director of the F.B.I., flew to Yemen to complain, but there was little further protest by the United States. We dropped the ball.
        
        A year and a half ago, when I briefed a bipartisan group of Senate staff members on Yemen, I warned that unless the American government sent a united message to the Yemenis to act against Al Qaeda, there would be future attacks against the United States connected to Yemen. Today, the terrorists behind the Cole are still free, and an attack connected to Yemen has been attempted.
        
        It is possible to defeat Al Qaeda in Yemen without sending American troops. Now that the Yemenis are once again acting against Al Qaeda by striking the terrorist group's bases and killing or apprehending many of its members, the United States must show that it has learned to stay focused and hold Yemeni officials accountable. This time, the terrorists must be permanently locked up, not allowed to escape or receive pardons. The most important sign of Yemen's sincerity will be when those with the blood of 17 American sailors on their hands are all brought to justice in the way they deserve.

        Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has rapidly evolved into an expanding and ambitious regional terrorist network thanks in part to a weakened, impoverished and distracted Yemeni government.
        
        While Yemen has been chasing two homegrown rebellions, Al Qaeda's cell here has begun sharing resources across borders over the past year and has been spurred on to more ambitious attacks by a leadership strengthened by detainees released from Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and by fighters returning from Iraq.
        
        Al Qaeda has flourished in the large, lawless and rugged tribal territories of Yemen, creating training camps, attacking Western targets and receiving increasing popular sympathy, Yemeni and U.S. officials say.
        
        Al Qaeda's growing profile in Yemen became clear after a Nigerian man, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, 23, was allegedly able to overstay his visa here by several months, connect with militants from Al Qaeda and leave this country with a bomb sewn into his underwear to try to blow up an airliner headed from Amsterdam to Detroit.
        
        The United States shut its embassy in Yemen's capital on Sunday, citing unspecified but "ongoing threats by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula," the regional branch that took responsibility for the failed bombing effort.
        
        Britain closed its embassy for similar reasons, news agencies reported Sunday. In December, the Yemeni government said it had attacked Qaeda meetings in which the group had been planning an attack on the embassy.
        
        The closure of the U.S. Embassy came a day after a quiet visit to the Yemeni president by Gen. David H. Petraeus, the regional U.S. military commander, who hand-delivered a message from President Barack Obama of support for Yemen's unity and counterterrorism efforts.
        
        In his weekly address Saturday, Mr. Obama for the first time directly blamed Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula for the bombing attempt and said fighting it would be a high priority.
        
        "In recent years, they have bombed Yemeni government facilities and Western hotels," he said, adding that he had made it "a priority to strengthen our partnership with the Yemeni government, training and equipping their security forces, sharing intelligence and working with them to strike Al Qaeda terrorists."
        
        On Saturday, Yemeni officials said they had sent more troops to fight Qaeda militants in the provinces of Abyan, Al Bayda and Shabwah.
        
        The core of Al Qaeda's group in Yemen is still thought to be small, perhaps no more than 200 people. But it has the important advantage of being part of a regional structure, having merged a year ago with the Saudi branch of Al Qaeda to form Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. And it has been able to originate fairly advanced operations here, in Saudi Arabia and now on an airliner headed for Detroit.
        
        Though Yemen played an early role in Al Qaeda's history - it is Osama bin Laden's ancestral homeland, and it was the staging ground for the attack on the U.S. Navy destroyer Cole in 2000 - the key chapters in the story of Al Qaeda's rise here have been written recently by leaders who were released from the U.S. prison at Guantánamo, escaped from Yemeni prisons or were drawn to shelter here by common cause and ideology.
        
        Those men have transformed and reoriented a weak local Qaeda cell that had made a kind of peace with the government after 2003. In the year since the Saudi and Yemeni branches merged, Al Qaeda has taken full advantage of the government's preoccupation with the rebellions, building support from the tribal structures and traditions in Yemen's poor and lawless territories.
        
        One big moment came in February 2006, when 23 imprisoned men suspected of being members of Al Qaeda escaped from a high-security prison, reportedly with the aid of some Yemeni security forces. All but three or four of the men were eventually recaptured or killed by Yemeni security forces. But one prisoner, Nasser al-Wuhayshi, became leader of the Yemeni cell of Al Qaeda and moved to reorganize it, focusing it on attacks against nearby Western targets. Another prisoner, Qassim al-Raimi, became the military commander.
        
        The next year, Mr. Wuhayshi found a deputy and, perhaps, a rival for leadership, Said Ali al-Shihri, 36, a Saudi citizen. He was released from six years' detention in Guantánamo in December 2007 to a Saudi-run rehabilitation program. Another Guantánamo detainee, also captured in Pakistan in 2001 and released to a Saudi rehabilitation program, is Ibrahim Suleiman al-Rubaysh, 30, a Saudi who also disappeared and is now described as the mufti, or theological guide, to Al Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula.
        
        Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born, English-speaking Internet imam of Al Qaeda here, returned to Yemen, his family's home, in 2004. He was arrested in 2006 on security charges and was released in December 2007 after 18 months in prison. He then went to Britain and is believed to have returned to Yemen last spring. Mr. Awlaki, 38, is not thought to have a major operational role. Still, U.S. and Yemeni officials say they believe he provided a crucial link to Mr. Abdulmutallab, first through the Internet and then by meeting him in Yemen and helping to recruit him to the airliner bomb plot.
        
        In recent years, Al Qaeda has had an increasingly rich recruiting pool.
        
        Magnus Ranstorp, a terrorism expert at the Swedish National Defense College, said that many of the nearly 2,000 Yemenis who were believed to have fought in Iraqi insurgencies had returned to join the cause here. And many Yemenis who went to Saudi Arabia to seek work - like Mr. bin Laden's father - have had children who have been influenced by the more radical Islam of Saudi Arabia, bringing ideas of jihad home to an already conservative Islamic Yemen.
        
        There has also been an influx to Yemen of at least 200,000 refugees from Somalia, according to official figures, and probably many more than that. Al Qaeda has also been very active in Somalia, seeking refuge and recruits among the Islamist groups there. And now that Yemen has proved to be a safe training ground for Al Qaeda, a link between the Yemeni and Somali contingents has strengthened.
        
        "The Somalia problem is merging with the Yemeni issue," Mr. Ranstorp said.
        
        But Al Qaeda here also has problems, including a possible leadership struggle. Its growth has come as President Ali Abdullah Saleh, 67, has intensified the war in the north against Houthi rebels, who are Shiites with support from Iran, according to Yemeni officials and analysts. Mr. Saleh's second priority is a spreading secessionist movement in the south, which has been largely peaceful until now but which further threatens his long hold on power, with his own succession unclear.
        
        "President Saleh's first priority is to stay in power," said Abdullah al-Faqih, a political scientist at Sana University.
        
        "Two, at this point, is the war in the north. Three is the south. And sometimes Al Qaeda doesn't even make the list at all - it drops from the agenda."
        
        In that regard, U.S. officials are finding an uncomfortable resemblance to their fight in Pakistan, where Al Qaeda's leadership is believed to have sanctuary in rugged tribal areas while the government is preoccupied with its archrival, India, and the disputed territory of Kashmir. And as in Pakistan, the U.S. military and intelligence involvement in Yemen must be cautious and seen as advisory, without putting troops on the ground. In addition to sending money, the United States has sent Special Forces troops to help train and equip Yemeni forces and has provided sophisticated satellite and communications intelligence.
        
        The streets outside the U.S. Embassy looked normal on Sunday, a working day here, with no visible addition to the boundary security provided by the Yemeni military and police. Nor were the streets closed off near the embassy building, which is surrounded by a large wall and is set back some distance as a precaution against bomb damage.
        
        Britain announced Sunday that Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Mr. Obama had agreed to back a counterterrorism police unit in Yemen to tackle the rising terrorist threat. There is already significant counterterrorist training for the police, and it was not immediately clear what Mr. Brown had in mind.
        
        Britain is also to host a high-level international conference on Jan. 28, in parallel to a long-scheduled conference on Afghanistan, to discuss international strategy and aid to counter radicalization in Yemen, the poorest country in the Arab world.
        
        In September 2008, Al Qaeda attacked the U.S. Embassy with a car bomb, and 19 people were killed - including an 18-year-old American woman, Yemeni security forces and six militants. It was after that attack that the United States began to step up its military and security aid to Yemen, with some $70 million spent in 2009, a figure that General Petraeus said would more than double in 2010.
        
        Yemen faces development challenges, including corruption and a major water shortage. Seventy percent of the gross domestic product comes from oil that is expected to run out in seven years.
        
        Mr. Faqih, the political scientist, warned that the president must seek political ways to calm the rebellions or risk creating even more recruits for Al Qaeda.
        
        "It can happen," Mr. Faqih said.
        
        "The enemy of my enemy is my friend, and you can turn it into the Kandahar of Yemen."

        Yemen faces development challenges, including corruption and a major water shortage. Seventy percent of the gross domestic product comes from oil that is expected to run out in seven years.
        
        Mr. Faqih, the political scientist, warned that the president must seek political ways to calm the rebellions or risk creating even more recruits for Al Qaeda.
        
        "It can happen," Mr. Faqih said.
        
        "The enemy of my enemy is my friend, and you can turn it into the Kandahar of Yemen."

    textlede: How al-Qaeda was allowed become such a major threat
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Yemenis say US policies have alienated locals, but the US says Yemen never made fighting al-Qaeda a priority, writes Sudarsan Raghavan in Yemen
        
        NINE YEARS after the bombing of the USS Cole, a combination of US and Yemeni missteps, deep mistrust and a lack of political will have allowed al-Qaeda militants here to regroup and pose a major threat to the United States, according to Yemeni and US officials, diplomats and analysts.
        
        The US failures have included a lack of focus on al-Qaeda s growing stature, insufficient funding and co-operation, and a misunderstanding of Yemen s complex political terrain, Yemeni officials and analysts said.
        
        US policies in the region, they said, often alienated top Yemeni officials and did little to address the root causes of militancy.
        
        Frustrated American officials say Yemen never made fighting al-Qaeda a top priority, which has stalled large-scale US support.
        
        These problems, which ultimately helped enable al-Qaeda militants to plot an attack on a US airliner on Christmas Day, have forced the US to open a new front in its anti-terrorism efforts. It is part of a largely invisible war, stretching from the Arabian Peninsula to Africa, waged from the skies and from high-tech intelligence centres, with unmanned drones, CIA operatives and vivid satellite images serving as the weapons of choice.
        
        It is a war that challenges the Obama administration in ways that echo the conflicts in Pakistan and Afghanistan. These issues were on display in a US-backed air strike in southern Yemen on December 17th. The government said it struck an al-Qaeda training camp, killing at least 23 militants.
        
        But tribal leaders and residents say mostly civilians were killed. The strike has generated an outpouring of anger and anti-American sentiment. I saw parts of bodies, mostly women and children, said Mukhbil Mohammed Ali, a tribal leader. America says it supports Yemen to eradicate terrorists. But America is only supporting Yemen to kill the innocent. After years of paltry assistance, the US last year provided $67 million in counterterrorism aid for training, intelligence and equipment. Assistance will more than double this year, Gen David Petraeus, the head of US Central Command, said on Friday in Baghdad before visiting Yemen on Saturday.
        
        US commandos are training Yemen s security forces and coast guard in counterterrorism tactics. American drones and satellites are guiding air strikes.
        
        But many say the war could arrive too late to change the trajectory in Yemen. Since the Coleattack, the nation has been on a path toward dissolution. The government is weak, unable to control large swathes of the country and its porous borders. It is stretched thin fighting a civil conflict in the north and a separatist movement in the south. It is burdened with crushing poverty and high unemployment; oil revenues and water supplies are shrinking.
        
        In this atmosphere, al-Qaeda has flourished. It is seeking to create an operational and training base to use Yemen, strategically tucked between oil-rich regions, important shipping routes and vast lawless areas, as a launching pad for global jihad. Increasingly, though, it is also targeting the government and its security apparatus.
        
        The attack on the USS Coleshould have been the loudest wake-up call against al-Qaeda, said Abdul Karim al-Iriyani, a former prime minister of Yemen. But I don t think, even when I was in government, every attention was given to fighting al-Qaeda. Now, it is much more difficult than 2000.
        
        On October 12th of that year, al-Qaeda militants rammed an explosives-packed speedboat into the USS Coledocked in the southern city of Aden, killing 17 US sailors. In the aftermath, Yemeni and US investigators worked together to tackle al-Qaeda, their co-operation increasing after the 9/11 attacks.
        
        In November 2002 a US Predator drone fired a missile at a car in eastern Yemen, killing six al-Qaeda suspects. They included the branch s leader, Abu Ali al-Harithi, whom the US had linked to the Colebombing.
        
        Stunned by the strike, senior Yemeni officials demanded that the Bush administration not reveal its involvement. Yemen is a conservative tribal society with deep sympathies for al-Qaeda s core message of protecting Islam. The government worried about a domestic backlash if it was known it had allowed the US to operate on its soil. But American officials soon announced its success. That decision eroded Yemeni trust in the US and damaged efforts to combat terrorism, Yemeni officials said. I was so angry, Iriyani recalled.
        
        US intelligence officials acknowledge that the strike posed a political liability for Yemen s president, Ali Abdullah Saleh. But they also contend that Yemen s government wavered in its commitment to fighting al-Qaeda even before that attack. By 2003 the US was focused on the Iraq war and appeared more intent on fighting corruption and promoting democracy in Yemen than on tackling al-Qaeda, experts said. American development aid to combat Yemen s poverty and high unemployment key factors in enticing new recruits to militancy was minuscule. US developmental aid to Yemen declined from $56.5 million in 2000 to $25.5 million in 2008, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. US officials say it was cut largely because of corruption concerns.
        
        When you look back and see how little attention Yemen was getting several years ago, it s shocking, said Christopher Boucek, a Yemen analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. None of these problems with Yemen s stability are new, and we ve known what was coming.
        
        In 2006, 23 al-Qaeda militants broke out of a maximum security jail in Sanaa, the capital. They included several operatives involved in the Coleattack, as well as Nasser al-Wahayshi, who became the leader of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.
        
        Yemeni and US officials say the militants were helped by Yemeni security officials sympathetic to al-Qaeda.
        
        US counterterrorism aid to Yemen was $4.6 million that year.
        
        Today, the jailbreak is viewed as the genesis of the current generation of al-Qaeda militants in Yemen. But it was two more years before the US substantially increased counterterrorism aid after al-Qaeda militants, including some who broke out of the jail, attacked the US embassy in September 2008, killing 16 people, including one American.
        
        The ghosts of the USS Colehave haunted the US-Yemen relationship throughout the past decade. All of the suspected attackers have been freed or escaped from prison, deepening tensions.
        
        Yemen s government has also refused to extradite to the US two al-Qaeda militants, including one convicted of masterminding the Coleattack. Yemeni officials say their constitution bars extradition.
        
        US officials said their counterterrorism efforts have also been hampered by a Yemeni government that has frequently been unpredictable and fickle. After early successes in arresting and killing al-Qaeda operatives after 9/11, Yemeni officials appeared to pull back out of fear of alienating powerful tribes and religious figures.
        
        In the past two weeks, the government has intensified its attack on militants, bolstered by increased US assistance and a sense that al-Qaeda is becoming a direct threat.
        
        But the more the government cracks down on suspected militants, the more vulnerable Yemen seems to become. In southern Yemen, opposition politicians and newspapers have accused the government of killing civilians in order to appease the US. Yemeni officials have acknowledged that women and children were killed, but say they were the relatives of the militants.
        
        The aggressive tactics could backfire. As in Pakistan, al-Qaeda militants thrive on the support and protection of tribes, who are highly sensitive about outside interference, even from the government. The militants live among the population, raising the odds of civilian casualties.
        
        Mukhbil Mohammed Ali, the tribal leader, said his tribesmen are angry. They have even more sympathy for al-Qaeda, he said, as well as a growing animosity towards the Yemen government and its benefactor, America.
        
        We all want revenge, he said.

    textlede: 'Orchard of fighters' has grown out of poverty and mistrust; A military approach to stop terrorists may send more Yemenis, who are already wary of western intervention, over to al-Qaeda, reports James Hider.
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        A new and more extreme generation of al-Qaeda has arisen in Yemen in the past three years, overstepping the traditional constraints that allowed for an uneasy truce with the Yemeni government, on which it has declared all-out war, experts warned Sunday.
        
        They said that a military approach to tackling the crisis would only exacerbate the problem, radicalizing tribes who were already sympathetic to the Islamists while failing to address key civil grievances such as massive underdevelopment, poverty and unequal distribution of key resources, in particular oil.
        
        "A western intervention, in particular a U.S. intervention, will provoke a backlash" among normal Yemenis, a conservative and poorly educated population distrustful of what they considered to be an aggressive West, Saeed al-Jemhi, the author of Al-Qaeda in Yemen, said.
        
        "This can only work in al-Qaeda's favour."
        
        Another analyst, who asked not to be named, said: "It's like a wasp's nest if you hit it with a stick."
        
        Both said that al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was composed mainly of Yemeni fighters who had experience of the U.S. intervention in Iraq, where they fought under the Jordanian leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.
        
        He was so brutal -- killing thousands of Shias in suicide bombings to provoke the civil war that almost destroyed Iraq -- that even Osama bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, urged him to rein in his bloody onslaught. Al-Zarqawi was killed by a U.S. airstrike in 2006.
        
        The latest group of terrorists have torn up a fragile detente with Ali Abdullah Saleh, the Yemeni president, and are trying to destroy the fabric of governance.
        
        Their predecessors, the al-Qaeda Mujahidin who fought with bin Laden in Afghanistan, returned to Yemen as heroes, and although they plotted attacks on foreign targets they did not go after the Yemeni authorities, who kept them under watch, but allowed them to remain at liberty.
        
        The newest group, however, has carried out numerous attacks inside the country, including on security forces, and declared the president a heretic -- tantamount to a death sentence.
        
        Yemen has always been a recruiting ground for al-Qaeda. Many of the first generation were young Yemeni men who travelled to Saudi Arabia for work and encountered the harsher Islamic ideology of Wahhabism espoused by Saudis.
        
        Saleh used the Islamist card in quelling rebellion in the former Marxist south in the civil war in the mid-1990s, which some analysts said partly explained his reluctance to confront al-Qaeda until he was forced to -- by western pressure and the new brand of extremism preached by the terrorists.
        
        The new group emerged after a prison break in Yemen in 2006 in which 23 top al-Qaeda members escaped from a high-security jail and started regrouping. Among them were leaders of the new formation, Nasser al-Wahishi, a former secretary to bin Laden, and Said Ali al-Shehri, a Saudi who was in Guantanamo for years before being released to a Saudi rehabilitation program.
        
        They based themselves in the mountains and deserts of eastern Yemen, which resembles Afghanistan and where the writ of the government has never extended. Many recruits were Yemeni, some of them tribal leaders who persuaded their people to offer refuge to the fighters and join them.
        
        "Al-Qaeda has become a banner for frustrated people," one Yemeni analyst said.
        
        Most agreed that military operations, while necessary to remove terrorist leaders, were not the way to tackle the problem. Poor areas needed development to take away the incentive to join the terrorists.
        
        The U.S. learned late in the day in Iraq that dealing with tribal leaders, in effect buying them off and offering jobs, was far more effective than fighting them.
        
        The government will also need to ensure the continuing loyalty of the Salafist sect, a hardline religious grouping with an almost identical ideology to al-Qaeda. Salafist leaders have so far rejected al-Qaeda, but al-Jemhi said that they were like an "orchard from which al-Qaeda will pick its fruits. Ninety-five per cent of them are ideologically ready for jihad. Al-Qaeda takes advantage of this to recruit them."
        
        Analysts said that no influential religious leaders had been persuaded to speak out against al-Qaeda. Experts also stressed the need for military operations to have a Yemeni face to avoid giving the impression that the U.S. was repeating its armed interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Pentagon said Sunday that no troops were scheduled to be sent to Yemen, although special forces have been training anti-terrorism forces there for at least two months.
        
        The Yemeni government faces many challenges. It is fighting a Shia Houthi rebellion in the north, which has taken most of its attention in recent years, and a secessionist movement in the oil-rich south.
        
        This has taken place against the backdrop of the failed Somali state across the Gulf of Aden. The al-Qaeda-affiliated Somali militia, known as al-Shabab, has pledged to send hundreds of fighters to Yemen to counter the U.S. and British involvement.
        
        The Somali government this week accused the Shia rebels in the north of Yemen -- believed by Sana'a to be receiving aid from Iran -- of sending weapons to al-Shabab despite the ideological gulf between the Shia and hardline Sunni groups.

        The West's plans to shore up the ailing regime of President Saleh has pro-democracy workers worried that he may use his new-found resources to stifle dissent (James Hider writes).
        
        Mr Saleh, below, came to power in 1977, when Yemen was still split between the Islamic north, which he ruled, and Marxist south. He had been a lieutenant-colonel in the army and was welcomed as a strong leader. When Yemen was united in 1990, he became head of state and his counterpart in the south head of government.
        
        In the 1999 presidential elections, the country's first, he won 91 per cent of the vote and subsequently extended the presidential term of office from five to seven years. He won again in 2006 with more than 70 per cent of the vote but critics began to accuse his Government of hoarding Yemen's resources in its power base of Sanaa and allowing grievances to erupt into violence.
        
        Although corruption and inefficiency have weakened Mr Saleh's rule, Yemeni governments are in part weak by design.
        
        Traditionally, they are less power centres than arbitrators between the main pillars of society - the merchants, the religious leaders, the tribes and the military.
        
        The rule of law has never taken hold in much of the country, critics say, with tribal leaders resolving disputes by haggling and powerful merchants dividing wealth behind closed doors.
        
        According to one, the President had not so much brokered power as consolidated it, using various security threats - the Shia rebellion in the north, secessionists in the south and now the terrorists - to gain Western support.
        
        "You cannot guarantee a ruler who came to power through the tank, not the ballot box," he said, arguing that increased military aid from the West needed to go hand in hand with increased diplomatic oversight to ensure that the aid was used against terrorists and not dissidents. Some believe that Mr Saleh is exaggerating the terrorist threat to tap into the vast sums of money the War on Terror conjures up from America.
        
        "The Government is blackmailing the West," said Abdulelah Haidar Shaea, an expert on terrorism.
        
        Divided nation
        
        The Yemeni capital, Sanaa, is one of the world's oldest cities, in a country occupied by a series of empires
        
        The Ottomans conquered Yemen in the 1500s and were quickly expelled but returned to the north in 1849
        
        The port of Aden was occupied by Britain in 1839 and run as a colony. It became a refuelling point for naval and merchant ships after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869
        
        North Yemen gained independence after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in 1918. The British withdrew from Aden in 1967 and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen - the Arab world's only Marxist state - was formed soon after
        
        The two halves of the country were united into the Republic of Yemen in 1990 but civil war broke out four years later as socialists in the oil-rich south attempted to secede
        
        The rebels were defeated in July 1994 but the Sanaa Government's hold remained fragile. In October 2000, 17 American sailors on board the USS Cole were killed by a suicide bomber and the British Embassy bombed

        Saudi Arabia has opened negotiations with its chief Gulf rival, Iran, for the release of Osama bin Laden's family from the high-security compound outside Tehran where they are being held (Hugh Tomlinson writes).
        
        The Saudi Foreign Ministry has confirmed that Riyadh is in talks with Iran for the release of the family after bin Laden's 17-year-old daughter, Iman, escaped from the compound late last year and took refuge at the Saudi Embassy in Tehran, seeking asylum.

    textlede: Iran, Yemen posing challenges to American intelligence
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        PARIS - While the government of Iran reels under the continuing pressures of popular uprising, whose character is inexorably changing from protest at a rigged election, contrived by the ambitious and obscurantist Revolutionary Guard, into a challenge to the Islamic government itself, the American-backed campaign for further sanctions on the economy, and inevitably the people, continues, to punish Iran's resistance to further international inspection of its nuclear facilities.
        
        The Israeli threat of military intervention also has been intensified, despite the public uprising against the Tehran regime and the perfectly real possibilities of a government upheaval that could prove of great and even pacific significance in the country's relationship with its neighbors, the U.S. and the International Atomic Energy Agency.
        
        It should be understood that there are two reasons why Iran's rivals would wish to attack that country. The first is to destroy a supposed nuclear threat to other countries. The other would be simply to cripple Iran as an industrial economy and major actor in the affairs of the region, as has happened to Iraq.
        
        In this respect, supposedly official documents demonstrating the military nature of the Iranian nuclear program continue to be distributed by unidentified sources. The latest, published in the Times of London on Dec. 14, purports to show that Tehran has worked upon or is working on a "nuclear initiator," a component in a nuclear weapon. The document is challenged by some independent intelligence sources because of its lack of an identifiable source, implausibility in the document itself, and because of its suspicious dating.
        
        American intelligence officials say the document "has yet to be authenticated."
        
        Its claimed date, later than November 2007, would be consistent with an effort to undermine the conclusion that Iranian work on nuclear weapons has ceased, which was the finding of the United States intelligence community's National Intelligence Estimate in 2007, which Washington has never repudiated.
        
        If this were not cheer enough for New Year's 2010, we have news of a new American military intervention into an Arab country of which Americans know next to nothing, the land of the Queen of Sheba, Yemen.
        
        The young son of a prominent Nigerian banker and former official, who studied engineering at the distinguished University College London, seems to have passed by Yemen in the peregrinations that on Christmas Eve took him to Amsterdam and Northwest Airlines Flight 253 to Detroit, which he attempted to blow up. This drew attention to Yemen, where a terrorist group has claimed that he is indeed one of their agents.
        
        This was no surprise to American security specialists, who have had their eye on Yemen for some time, with Special Forces operators reportedly active in a $70 million plan to train counterterrorism forces, while unofficially assisting in certain operations against this group, which calls itself "al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula."
        
        Sen. Joe Lieberman and other officials visited Yemen in August, and Lieberman declared that "Yemen now becomes one of the centers" of the fight against lawlessness. Gen. David H. Petraeus had been there earlier in the summer.
        
        U.S. officials are quoted by The New York Times as saying the country could become "al-Qaida's next operational and training hub, rivaling the lawless tribal areas of Pakistan," which suggests that the American "surge" in Afghanistan might soon find a rival claim on American resources from Yemen, a country engaged in regional civil war until 1990.
        
        That year, Arab League mediation culminated in a constitutional agreement between Yemen's rival republics, the nationalist and Marxist People's Democratic Republic and the nationalist and Nasserist Yemen Arab Republic, mainly identifiable as representing, respectively, northerners and southerners. Yemen also enjoys the anxious regard of its large and not particularly friendly neighbor, Saudi Arabia.
        
        In the time of the Queen of Sheba, in the first millennium B.C., Yemen was known for its rich and prosperous trade in spices and incense. Today its exportable resources are cotton, salt, gypsum and stone. It had some oil, but this reportedly is running out. There are possibly exploitable natural gas resources. The estimated population is 24 million, with a per capita annual individual income with a purchasing power equivalent to $870.
        
        The reliable Statesman's Yearbook reports that Yemen possesses an estimated four firearms for every person in its population and is therefore "arguably the world's most heavily-armed country."
        
        The United States and Israel will be relieved to know that it is a signatory to the international nuclear non-proliferation treaty.

    textlede: US, UK close Yemen embassies over al-Qaida threats
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        SAN'A, Jan. 3 -- The U.S. and Britain closed their embassies in Yemen on Sunday in the face of al-Qaida threats, after both countries announced an increase in aid to the government to fight the terror group linked to the failed attempt to bomb a U.S. airliner on Christmas.
        
        The confrontation with al-Qaida's offshoot in Yemen has gained new urgency since the 23-year-old Nigerian accused in the attack, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, told American investigators he received training and instructions from the group's operatives in Yemen. President Barack Obama said Saturday that the al-Qaida offshoot was behind the attempt.
        
        White House counterterrorism chief John Brennan said the American Embassy, which was attacked twice in 2008, was shut Sunday because of "indications al-Qaida is planning to carry out an attack against a target inside of San'a, possibly our embassy."
        
        "We're not going to take any chances" with the lives of embassy personnel, Brennan said. A statement on the embassy's Web site announcing the closure did not say how long it would remain closed.
        
        In London, Britain's Foreign Office said its embassy was closed for security reasons. It said officials would decide later whether to reopen it on Monday.
        
        The closure comes as Washington is dramatically stepping up aid to Yemen to fight al-Qaida, which has built up strongholds in remote parts of the impoverished, mountainous nation where government control outside the capital is weak.
        
        Over the weekend, Gen. David Petraeus, the U.S. general who oversees the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, announced that Washington this year will more than double the $67 million in counterterrorism aid that it provided Yemen in 2009. On Saturday, Petraeus met with Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh to discuss coordination in the fight against al-Qaida.
        
        Britain announced Sunday that Washington and London will fund a counterterrorism police unit in Yemen. Britain will also host a high-level international conference Jan. 28 to come up with an international strategy to counter radicalization in Yemen.
        
        The U.S. also provided intelligence and other help to back two Yemeni air and ground assaults on al-Qaida hide-outs last month, reported to have killed more than 60 people. Yemeni authorities said more than 30 suspected militants were among the dead.
        
        The U.S. has increasingly provided intelligence, surveillance and training to Yemeni forces during the past year, and has provided some firepower, a senior U.S. defense official has said. Some of that assistance may be through the expanded use of unmanned drones, and the U.S. is providing funding to Yemen for helicopters and other equipment. Officials, however, say there are no U.S. ground forces or fighter aircraft in Yemen.
        
        On Thursday, the embassy sent a notice to Americans in Yemen urging them to be vigilant about security.
        
        Yemeni security officials said over the weekend that the country had deployed several hundred extra troops to Marib and Jouf, two mountainous eastern provinces that are al-Qaida's main strongholds in the country and where Abdulmutallab may have visited. U.S. and Yemeni investigators have been trying to track Abdulmutallab's steps in Yemen, which he visited from August until Dec. 7. He was there ostensibly to study Arabic in San'a, but he disappeared for much of that time.
        
        Yemeni media also reported that the coast guard was increasing patrols to stop any incoming militants after an al-Qaida-linked insurgent group in Somalia, al-Shabab, claimed last week that it would send its fighters to help the terror group's offshoot there.
        
        Al-Qaida fighters have dramatically increased their presence in Yemen over the past year, taking advantage of the San'a government's weak control over much of the country. Tribes hold sway over large areas, and many of them are discontented with the central government and have given refuge to al-Qaida fighters, both Yemenis and other Arabs coming from Saudi Arabia or war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan.
        
        Yemen, the ancestral homeland of Osama bin Laden, was the scene of the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole, and in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States, the Yemeni government worked with Washington to crack down on al-Qaida figures on its soil.
        
        But the terror group has rallied, announcing in January 2009 the creation of Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, grouping fighters from Yemen and neighboring Saudi Arabia. The leader of the group, Naser Abdel Karim al-Wahishi, is a Yemeni who was once close to bin Laden, and two Saudis who were released from the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay in 2007 and 2006 have taken up senior roles - Said al-Shihri, the group's deputy leader, and Ibrahim Suleiman al-Rubaish, seen as its theological adviser.
        
        The Yemeni government, meanwhile, has been tied down battling two separate internal rebellions in the north and south. The various conflicts and the country's poverty and lack of resources have raised fears that instability could deepen.
        
        Located at the tip of the Arabian peninsula, Yemen straddles a strategic maritime crossroads at the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, the access point to the Suez Canal. Across the Gulf is Somalia, an even more tumultuous nation where the U.S. has said al-Qaida militants have been increasing their activity. Yemen also borders Saudi Arabia, the world's leading oil producer.
        
        There have been a spate of assaults on the U.S. Embassy in Yemen.
        
        In an attack in September 2008, gunmen and two vehicles packed with explosives attacked the U.S. Embassy, killing 19 people, including an 18-year-old American woman and six militants. None of those killed or wounded were U.S. diplomats or embassy employees. Al-Qaida in Yemen claimed responsibility.
        
        In March 2008, three mortars missed the U.S. Embassy and crashed into a high school for girls nearby, killing a security guard. In March 2003, two people were shot dead and dozens more were wounded as police clashed with demonstrators trying to storm the embassy.
        
        Last January, gunmen in a car exchanged fire with police at a checkpoint near the embassy, hours after the embassy received threats of a possible attack by al-Qaida. Nobody was injured. In April, embassy personnel were put on a one-week lockdown, barred from leaving their homes or the embassy after al-Qaida suicide bombings that targeted South Korean visitors.
        
        As recently as July, security was upgraded in San'a after intelligence reports warned of attacks planned against the U.S. Embassy.

    textlede: Scenes From the War on Terrorism in Yemen
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Ali H. Soufan was an F.B.I. special agent from 1997 to 2005.
        
        
        
        The evidence that Al Qaeda's branch in Yemen had a role in the failed Christmas Day bombing of an American passenger jet has led some to declare that Yemen is the new front in the war against the terrorist organization. But the truth is, Yemen has been a front in that war since at least Oct. 12, 2000, when Al Qaeda blew up the Navy destroyer Cole, killing 17 American sailors, in the port of Aden. The explosives for the bombing were bought in Yemen. And the attackers and their accomplices were predominantly Yemenis. Indeed, after the attack, terrorists in Qaeda camps in Afghanistan would march and chant, "We, the Yemenis, destroyed the Cole."
        
        As the F.B.I. case agent for the Cole investigation from 2000 to 2005, I spent years with colleagues in Yemen hunting down those responsible, and we unraveled an entire Qaeda network in the country.
        
        Even before the Cole attack, Yemen was linked to terrorist acts. Most of the people who executed the 1998 East African embassy bombings either traveled through Yemen or used fraudulent Yemeni passports. Almost two years after the Cole, Qaeda terrorists based in Yemen struck the Limburg, a French oil tanker, off the coast of Yemen. Qaeda terrorists in Yemen also helped facilitate the attacks of 9/11. Fahd al-Quso, a Yemeni Qaeda member who confessed to me his role in the U.S.S. Cole bombing, also admitted to ferrying money to a Qaeda operative known as Khallad who was part of an important 9/11 planning meeting in Malaysia.
        
        As recently as this past August, an assassination attempt against Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, Saudi Arabia's deputy minister of interior in charge of security, was plotted in Yemen. The explosive mixture that the suicide bomber used in that attack was the same one that Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab tried to ignite on the passenger jet over Detroit -- and in each case the terrorist hid the mixture in his underwear.
        
        Yemen is a very appealing base for Al Qaeda for various reasons. From its position at the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, the country has convenient access to Al Qaeda's main theaters of battle, including Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan. Its borders are unsecured, and tribal groups sympathetic to Al Qaeda control many regions, so terrorists can move freely into, out of and around the country. And guns and explosives are readily available from Yemen's thriving arms market.
        
        The country's tribal nature also makes it a relatively easy place for Al Qaeda to operate. Yemen has a weak government and powerful regional tribes, which in many ways operate as mini-governments free of central control. In addition, the government is struggling to contain both a secessionist movement in the south and a rebellion in the north. Rampant poverty and illiteracy make it easy for Al Qaeda to buy local support and manipulate Yemenis into believing its propaganda.
        
        When I was in Yemen, I found many extremely capable officials in law enforcement and intelligence who were dedicated to stopping Al Qaeda. With their help, and with support from American intelligence and military agencies, our F.B.I. team was able to arrest and prosecute in a Yemeni court people responsible for the Cole bombing and for planning other attacks. By the time we left Yemen, in 2005, those terrorists were in prison.
        
        Later, however, some of them "escaped," and others were given clemency. Jamal al-Badawi, for example, a Qaeda terrorist who confessed to me his role in the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole, was sentenced to death by a Yemeni judge in 2004. But in 2006, he "escaped" from jail, only to turn himself in the next year -- in a deal that released him from prison on a promise of good behavior. Today, Mr. Quso, the confessed Cole bomber, is not only free, he's giving interviews and re-establishing himself as a terrorist operative.
        
        During the past year, in an ominous sign of Yemen's rising importance to Al Qaeda, the Saudi branch of the organization merged with the Yemeni branch to form a single terrorist group for the entire peninsula. Known as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, it is based in Yemen and headed by a Yemeni, Naser Abdel-Karim al-Wahishi, who served as a close aide to Osama bin Laden. Mr. Wahishi "escaped" from jail with Mr. Badawi.
        
        Some Yemeni government officials highly value their relationship with the United States, which provides financial aid and military training. During our investigation of the Cole bombing, when the American government made it clear to the Yemenis that they expected full cooperation, the Yemenis who were dedicated to justice were given free rein and those with extremist ties were sidelined. After the trials were over and the terrorists made it out of jail, Robert S. Mueller III, the director of the F.B.I., flew to Yemen to complain, but there was little further protest by the United States. We dropped the ball.
        
        A year and a half ago, when I briefed a bipartisan group of Senate staff members on Yemen, I warned that unless the American government sent a united message to the Yemenis to act against Al Qaeda, the terrorists responsible for the Cole would remain free and there would be future attacks against the United States connected to Yemen. Today, the terrorists behind the Cole are still free, and an attack connected to Yemen has been attempted.
        
        It is possible to defeat Al Qaeda in Yemen without sending American troops. Now that the Yemenis are once again acting against Al Qaeda by striking the terrorist group's bases and killing or apprehending many of its members, the United States must show that it has learned to stay focused and hold Yemeni officials accountable. This time, the terrorists must be permanently locked up, not allowed to escape or receive pardons. The most important sign of Yemen's sincerity will be when those with the blood of 17 American sailors on their hands are all brought to justice in the way they deserve.

    textlede: Yemen's Chaos Aids Evolution Of Qaeda Cell
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has rapidly evolved into an expanding and ambitious regional terrorist network thanks in part to a weakened, impoverished and distracted Yemeni government.
        
        While Yemen has chased two homegrown rebellions, over the last year the Qaeda cell here has begun sharing resources across borders and has been spurred on to more ambitious attacks by a leadership strengthened by released Qaeda detainees and returning fighters from Iraq.
        
        The priorities of the Yemeni government have been fighting a war in the north and combating secessionists across the south. In the interim, Al Qaeda has flourished in the large, lawless and rugged tribal territories of Yemen, creating training camps, attacking Western targets and receiving increasing popular sympathy, Yemeni and American officials say.
        
        Al Qaeda's growing profile in Yemen became clear after a Nigerian man, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, 23, was able to overstay his visa here by several months, connect with Qaeda militants and leave this country with a bomb sewn into his underwear.
        
        In his weekly address on Saturday, President Obama for the first time directly blamed Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula for the bombing attempt and said that fighting the group would be a high priority.
        
        "In recent years, they have bombed Yemeni government facilities and Western hotels," he said, adding, "So as president, I've made it a priority to strengthen our partnership with the Yemeni government."
        
        The core of the group here is still thought to be small, perhaps no more than 200 people. But the group has the important advantage of being part of a larger, regional structure, having merged a year ago with the Saudi branch of Al Qaeda to form Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. And it has been able to originate fairly sophisticated operations here, in Saudi Arabia and now on an airliner headed for Detroit.
        
        Though Yemen played an early role in Al Qaeda's history -- it is Osama bin Laden's ancestral homeland, and it was the staging ground for the 2000 attack on the American destroyer Cole -- the key chapters in the story of Al Qaeda's rise here have been written recently by leaders who were released from detention at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, escaped from Yemeni prisons or were drawn to shelter here by common cause and ideology.
        
        Those men have transformed and reoriented a weak local Qaeda cell that had made a kind of peace with the government after 2003. In the year since the Saudi and Yemeni branches merged, Al Qaeda has taken full advantage of the government's preoccupation with the rebellions, building support from the tribal structures and traditions in Yemen's poor and lawless territories.
        
        One big moment came in February 2006, when 23 imprisoned men suspected of being members of Al Qaeda escaped from a high-security prison, reportedly with the aid of some Yemeni security forces. All but three or four of the men were eventually recaptured or killed by Yemeni security forces. But one prisoner, Nasser al-Wuhayshi, became leader of the Qaeda cell in Yemen and moved to reorganize it, focusing it on attacks against nearby Western targets. Another prisoner, Qassim al-Raimi, became the military commander.
        
        The next year, Mr. Wuhayshi found a deputy and, perhaps, a rival for leadership, Said Ali al-Shihri, 36, a Saudi citizen. He was released from six years' detention in Guantanamo Bay in December 2007 to a Saudi-run rehabilitation program. He disappeared from Saudi Arabia and emerged in Yemen, and he is considered by many to be the rising star of the local movement. Mr. Shihri had traveled to Afghanistan in 2001 and was apparently wounded there, and he was captured crossing back into Pakistan in December of that year.
        
        Another Guantanamo detainee, also captured in Pakistan in 2001 and released to a Saudi rehabilitation program, is Ibrahim Suleiman al-Rubaysh, 30, a Saudi who also disappeared and is now described as the mufti, or theological guide, to Al Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula.
        
        Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born, English-speaking Internet imam of Al Qaeda here, returned to Yemen, his family's home, in 2004. He was arrested in 2006 on security charges and was released in December 2007 after 18 months in prison. He then went to Britain and is believed to have returned to Yemen last spring.
        
        Mr. Awlaki, 38, is not thought to have a major operational role. Still, American and Yemeni officials say they believe he provided a crucial link to Mr. Abdulmutallab, first through the Internet and then by meeting him in Yemen and helping to recruit him to the airliner bomb plot. He also provides Qaeda operatives here with a crucial shield against the government: the protection of his powerful tribe, the Awlakis. As in Afghanistan and Pakistan, tribal codes require the protection of those who seek refuge and help -- even more so for a clan member and his colleagues. Mr. Awlaki is also said to have helped negotiate deals with other tribal leaders.
        
        Abdulelah Hider Shaea, a Yemeni journalist who studies Al Qaeda and knows Mr. Awlaki, denied in an interview that the imam was a member of Al Qaeda, saying instead that he served as an articulate window to jihadism for English speakers.
        
        Yemeni officials, in two major strikes against Qaeda targets in December, first said that they had killed Mr. Awlaki, but he later spoke to Mr. Shaea to prove that he was alive, as other key leaders seem to be. But dozens of Qaeda family members and local residents were killed, increasing antigovernment sentiment.
        
        In recent years, Al Qaeda has had an increasingly rich recruiting pool.
        
        Magnus Ranstorp, a terrorism expert at the Swedish National Defense College, said that many of the nearly 2,000 Yemenis who were believed to have fought in Iraqi insurgencies had returned to join the cause here. And many Yemenis who went to Saudi Arabia to seek work -- like Mr. bin Laden's father -- have had children who have been influenced by the more radical Islam of Saudi Arabia, bringing ideas of jihad home to an already conservative Islamic Yemen.
        
        There has also been an influx to Yemen of at least 200,000 refugees from Somalia, according to official figures, and probably many more than that. Al Qaeda has also been very active in Somalia, seeking refuge and recruits among the Islamist groups there. And now that Yemen has proved to be a safe training ground for Al Qaeda, a link between the Yemeni and Somali contingents has strengthened.
        
        "The Somalia problem is merging with the Yemeni issue," Mr. Ranstorp said.
        
        But Al Qaeda here also has problems, including a possible leadership struggle.
        
        Although Mr. Wuhayshi is still widely believed to be in control, he is considered uncharismatic, and his leadership and the merger were not endorsed by Mr. bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, until spring 2009. But the airliner plot has brought praise from Qaeda-associated Web sites, as did a bold but unsuccessful effort to kill Saudi Arabia's counterterrorism chief, Prince Muhammad bin Nayef, who was wounded last August by a suicide bomber equipped with the same explosive provided to Mr. Abdulmutallab.
        
        Al Qaeda's growth here has come as President Ali Abdullah Saleh, 67, has intensified the war in the north against Houthi rebels, who are Shiites with support from Iran, according to Yemeni officials and analysts. Mr. Saleh's second priority is a spreading secessionist movement in the south, which has been largely peaceful until now but which further threatens his long hold on power, with his own succession unclear.
        
        "President Saleh's first priority is to stay in power," said Abdullah al-Faqih, a political scientist at Sana University.
        
        "Two, at this point, is the war in the north. Three is the south. And sometimes Al Qaeda doesn't even make the list at all -- it drops from the agenda."
        
        In that regard, American officials are finding an uncomfortable resemblance to their fight in Pakistan, where Al Qaeda's leadership is believed to have sanctuary in rugged tribal areas while the government is preoccupied with its archrival India and the disputed territory of Kashmir. And as in Pakistan, the American military and intelligence involvement in Yemen must be cautious and seen as advisory, without putting troops on the ground.
        
        In addition to sending money, the United States has sent Special Forces troops to help train and equip Yemeni forces and has provided sophisticated satellite and communications intelligence.
        
        Yemen is also the Arab world's poorest country, with a major water shortage and 70 percent of the gross domestic product coming from oil that is expected to run out in seven years, and it is also deeply corrupt.
        
        The new American focus and money have caught Mr. Saleh's attention, Mr. Faqih, the political scientist, said.
        
        "But right now we have the military in the north and the security services in the south," he said.
        
        "Of course, we're not ready to fight Al Qaeda. You'd have to reposition the government and the security forces, and it would take months."
        
        Still, Al Qaeda is also becoming more of a threat to Yemen. In November, Al Qaeda attacked government forces in the Kushum Al Ain area of Hadramawt Province. Three officials were killed. Later that month, near Marib, Al Qaeda executed a senior intelligence officer after holding him for months and then trying him, as if it were the real government of the area.
        
        Al Qaeda has also declared support for the secessionist protests in the south and is thought to be strong in southern Abyan Province, which gives it access to the sea.
        
        Despite the threat, "relations between the government and Al Qaeda are very tricky," Mr. Faqih noted.
        
        "There is, as in Pakistan, some intertwining of politics, society and the security forces with Al Qaeda," he said. Al Qaeda has been skillful in making alliances of its own with important tribes in provinces like Hadramawt, Shabwah, Marib, where much of the oil is, and Abyan.
        
        Some of that intertwining has happened because President Saleh has been encouraging a radical Sunni Islamist group to help fight the Shiite Houthi rebellion in the north. Some analysts say they believe that movement is also feeding the support for Al Qaeda. Mr. Saleh has also used jihadis who fought in Afghanistan and Iraq against the Houthis, as he used some of them to fight in the south during the country's 1994 civil war.
        
        Mr. Faqih warned that Mr. Saleh must seek political ways to calm the rebellions or risk creating even more recruits for Al Qaeda. The war against the Houthis is pushing them toward some kind of alliance with Al Qaeda, despite religious differences, much as Shiite Iran backs the Sunni Hamas movement in Gaza, he said.
        
        "It can happen," Mr. Faqih said.
        
        "The enemy of my enemy is my friend, and you can turn it into the Kandahar of Yemen."

    textlede: National: Airline Bomb Plot: Yemeni air attacks on al-Qaida fighters risk mobilising hostile tribes: DISPATCH BY HUGH MACLEOD AND NASSER ARRABYEE IN SANAA
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        When Yemeni MiG-29 aircraft sent missiles crashing into a suspected terrorist training camp in al-Majalah, a remote area of Abyan in the south, the local reaction quickly turned from horror to anger.
        
        The raids, a week before Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab's failed attempt to blow up a Christmas Day flight from Amsterdam to Detroit, succeeded in killing key figures in the Yemeni wing of al-Qaida which helped train him. Mohammed Saleh al-Kazimi, the leader of al-Qaida in Abyan and head of the local Ambor tribe, along with his wife and children, was among them. But they were far from the only casualties.
        
        Local sources said about 50 people were killed, and some 60 injured. It was said that the al-Qaida fighters had been living in the village alongside their families, training at a camp just metres from the homes. But the deaths of women and children enraged some locals.
        
        "Kazimi has the right to live with his family, and if he is a member of al-Qaida then he should have been punished alone," said Mukbel Ali al-Ambori, a leader of the Ambor tribe.
        
        "But 45 women and children and more than 1,000 animals were killed."
        
        Officials accused one of the leaders of Yemen's southern separatist movement, Tarek al-Fadhli, a powerful local tribal chief, of allowing al-Qaida to run the camp under his protection.
        
        The deputy prime minister for defence and security affairs, Rashad al-Alimi, said 24 al-Qaida suspects were killed, most of them Ambor tribesmen, but also two Saudis, two Pakistanis and an unknown number of Egyptians, as well as five other unidentified foreigners. A security source said five al-Qaida operatives were injured and later arrested in the southern port city of Aden.
        
        The recriminations in the aftermath of the al-Majalah raid underline the dilemmas facing the Yemeni government and its deeply unpopular western allies, as they combat the emerging terrorist threat in the country's east and south. Later this month Gordon Brown will host an emergency summit on Yemen.
        
        Abdulmutallab is believed to have received al-Qaida training at a similar camp to the one devastated a week before Christmas. Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) claimed responsibility for the failed attack, saying it was retaliation for the US military support to Yemen in its offensive against the militants. But disentangling a hostile local population from the al-Qaida fighters and leaders who have infiltrated the region will be a hugely difficult task.
        
        Senior Yemeni officials told the Observer that al-Qaida had been successful at buying the loyalty of local people.
        
        "No one gets recruited free of charge. Al-Qaida come with resources to pay people," said Abdel Karim Aryani, an adviser to Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh.
        
        "The religious appeal helps, but poverty is at the root of all Yemen's problems, including al-Qaida."
        
        Speaking to the Observer two days before the Abyan air strike, the commander of Yemen's British- and US-trained counter-terrorism forces warned of the difficulties of attacking al-Qaida where it is hosted by local tribes.
        
        "Al-Qaida touch on very sensitive issues in tribal areas. They come in the name of God and religion and talk about Palestine and the occupation of Iraq and people sympathise with them," said Brigadier Yehya Abdullah Saleh, a nephew of the president.
        
        "We don't want to fight with the tribes, so it is better to take out al-Qaida members one by one when they are separate from the tribes, or we risk a big war."
        
        New details on the pre-Christmas raids suggest that US support and effective intelligence-gathering helped Yemen strike a serious blow against al-Qaida, but that its top leadership, including a member of the al-Qaida cell that attacked the USS Cole in Yemen in 2000, narrowly escaped death. And reporting by the Observer reveals the extent to which al-Qaida has integrated itself with powerful tribes that control large swaths of Yemen's rugged east and parts of its south.
        
        The poorest country in the Middle East, Yemen remains a tribal society, as complicated to rule as Afghanistan, where clan elders and the armed men they command often trump the authority of the central government.
        
        The Yemeni people are among the most heavily armed in the world. In a population of 25 million, there are believed to be some 60 million guns, while carrying arms is a rite of passage for young men growing up inside the traditions of their tribe.
        
        The authorities said they were compelled to launch the all-out offensive on AQAP after receiving intelligence that an eight-man al-Qaida cell was poised to launch a wave of car bombings and suicide attacks against western targets. According to an official statement, the targets included the British embassy in Sanaa, previous targeted in a foiled attack in 2005, as well as schools - presumably those teaching western students, such as the capital's many language centres, one of which Abdulmutallab studied at - and oil companies.
        
        As the air force pounded Abyan at dawn on 17 December, counter-terrorism forces stormed an al-Qaida safe house in Arhab, 70km north-east of Sanaa. In the ensuing gun battle three of the would-be suicide bombers were killed, said a security source, including Hani al-Shalan, a former Guantanamo prisoner released to Yemen in June 2006.
        
        Qasem al-Raimi, a top military commander of AQAP, escaped the Arhab raid along with Hezam Mujali, a leader of the suicide bombers. Hezam's brother Arif was captured, along with six others, and taken for interrogation. In February 2006, Raimi, the military commander, had escaped from a maximum-security prison in Yemen along with Nasser Wahayshi, now the leader of AQAP.
        
        In Sanaa, meanwhile, counter-terrorism officers raided homes, arresting 14 suspected al-Qaida operatives who were to have provided assistance to the suicide bombers.
        
        But the attacks on Arhab and Abyan prompted an angry response by local tribes. Meeting at their traditional gathering place, leaders of the Arhab tribe discussed how to secure the release of several of their members arrested in the raid, including the brother of an MP, Sheikh Mansour Ali al-Hanaq, whose relative fought with the mujahideen in Afghanistan in the 1980s.
        
        Prominent members of the Arhab tribe include one of Yemen's senior religious scholars, Sheikh Abdel Majid al-Zindani, who was listed in 2004 by the US as a specially designated global terrorist for his suspected links to Osama bin Laden. It is not known if he attended the meeting.
        
        At the site of the Abyan air strike a couple of days later, al-Qaida member Mohamed Saleh al-Awlaki urged a gathering of thousands of tribesmen to stand by al-Qaida.
        
        "The war in Yemen is between al-Qaida and the US, and not between al-Qaida and the Yemeni army," shouted Mohammed, who was filmed with his face uncovered.
        
        "Victory is coming soon," he promised.
        
        Awlaki was a relative of Fahd al-Kusaa, once imprisoned for his involvement in the bombing of the USS Cole, and also a cousin of Anwar al-Awlaki, a US-born Yemeni preacher who lectured some of the 11 September hijackers and was in contact with Nidal Hassan, the US army psychiatrist, in the months leading up to his massacre at Fort Hood.
        
        Local sources and Yemeni security officials said AQAP's leaders, Nasser Wahayshi and his Saudi deputy, Saeed al-Shihri, who was released from Guantanamo in 2008, travelled to Abyan to mourn the death of Kazimi, the tribesman who had led the local al-Qaida cell.
        
        After the funeral the senior AQAP men were tracked, most probably by US drones, back to a farm in Rafdh in Shabwa, 600km east of Sanaa, belonging to Fahd al-Qusaa, the USS Cole bomber.
        
        An official statement said the farm was being used for a meeting chaired by Wahayshi and Shihri. On 24 December, a day before the failed Detroit terror attack, missiles slammed into the farmhouse, killing at least five confirmed al-Qaida members: Mohammed Awlaki and four of his relatives. Brigadier Saleh, the head of Yemen's counter-terrorism forces, told the Observer that the war against al-Qaida in his country is far from over, urging more assistance for his troops from the US and Britain.

    textlede: World: Obama takes on opponents over national security lapse: Right's criticisms spur president to take a hard line as Yemen adds to the mounting threats to America from around the world
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        President Barack Obama took on his Republican critics over national security yesterday by declaring that the United States remained at war with terrorists and vowing to strike at those behind the Christmas Day aircraft bomb attempt.
        
        The move marked a dramatic shift in tone from the White House, which has endured a week of withering attacks from Republicans who said it had mismanaged the response to the failed attack.
        
        Obama used his weekly radio address to respond to comments by the former vice-president, Dick Cheney, accusing him of pretending America was not at war. Obama insisted he had said America was at war from his first day in office: "On that day I also made it very clear that our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred, and that we will do whatever it takes to defeat them and defend our country."
        
        To back up his hard line, Obama also blamed the Christmas Day attack on al-Qaida in the Arabian peninsula. He said the group had equipped and sent out the Nigerian-born bomber Umar Abdulmutallab and would now be brought to justice.
        
        "All those involved in the attempted act of terrorism on Christmas must know: you, too, will be held to account," Obama said.
        
        It is unlikely, however, that Obama's stance will do much to appease his Republican critics. The right has been eager to attack him on a range of issues from Iran to Guantanamo Bay to Afghanistan. Yet at the same time Obama is also coming under pressure from the leftwing of his own party and liberal groups which see him as continuing too many of the Bush policies.
        
        Yemen has now emerged as an unwelcome new front. America has been providing support for the Yemeni government in its battle with Islamist militants, but the country has become more unstable and terrorist attacks from there more frequent. Before the attempted aircraft bombing, a radical Yemeni cleric was linked to the recent shooting at Fort Hood where a Muslim American killed his fellow soldiers. The issue has been further complicated by the fact that several former Yemeni detainees at Guantanamo Bay have been linked to the recent aircraft attack.
        
        Many of the criticisms levelled at Obama have had a strong echo of those that followed 11 September 2001. Critics have pointed out that much key information was known about the attackers, but had not been co-ordinated among intelligence agencies. Indeed, reforms brought in by Bush, such as creating the Department of Homeland Security, may have made the problem worse.
        
        "We are still having the co-ordinating problems that we had before 9/11. There is too much bureaucracy," said Ivan Eland, director of the Centre on Peace and Liberty at the Independent Institute thinktank.
        
        Obama has already ordered a review of procedures for intelligence gathering and information sharing, and will hold a meeting of top staff on Tuesday. In his radio address, he said he would ensure there was more effective co-ordination and that people would be held more accountable for their actions.
        
        "Let us ask the questions that need to be asked. Let us make the changes that need to be made. Let us debate the best way to protect the country we all love," he said.
        
        One of the few brighter spots in Obama's troubled national security landscape is North Korea. Though relations with the nuclear-armed state are always unpredictable, recent signs point to a potential thaw in relations. A US envoy recently visited the country and Pyongyang's new year message expressed a desire for a peace treaty with the US and South Korea.
        
        Iran, however, remains problematic. Tehran's quest for a domestic nuclear programme, and international efforts to prevent it from developing weapons, will this week enter a new phase of diplomatic brinkmanship.
        
        Last week tens of thousands of supporters of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's regime demonstrated in Tehran in organised protests against foreign interference in Iran's affairs.
        
        Less remarked on was the fact that a deadline for Iran to accept a UN-brokered deal passed on Thursday and raised the prospect of a fresh round of sanctions against Tehran. The country is already under three sets of UN sanctions for its programme of uranium enrichment, the process that can eventually lead to making the key components of an atomic bomb.
        
        Instead a senior Iranian figure said that the west had just one month to come up with a better deal for it to swap its low-enriched uranium for nuclear fuel. The international community had to decide whether it will accept Iran's conditions, otherwise "Tehran will enrich uranium to a higher level", Manouchehr Mottaki, Iran's foreign minister, was quoted as saying on state television.
        
        "This is an ultimatum," he added.
        
        Many experts, however, think any resolution to the situation is unlikely. Critics of Tehran have alleged that the regime is using negotiations as a delaying tactic while it pursues its nuclear weapons ambitions. They say that much of the programme remains shrouded in secrecy and doubt the country's stated peaceful intentions, accusing it instead of wanting to build a bomb.
        
        Israel, which has been repeatedly threatened by Iran, has said it will not tolerate Iran becoming a nuclear power, and Israeli hawks have often raised the prospect of using a military strike to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities. Most western diplomats believe such an attack would be a disaster that could ignite a much wider Middle East conflict.

    textlede: In the New Year, Get Serious About Iran and National Security
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Well, Aloha to you too. I'm amazed you would come all the way out here to the beaches of Hawaii for one of our conversations. Can I have my footman get you a flower-print shirt and a mai-tai?
        
        No thanks - but I sure could use the mai-tai. Or a couple.
        
        You're upset? About what?
        
        Sir, principally about two things - Iran and your administration's seeming ignorance and incompetence regarding both jihadist terror and national security.
        
        Get a grip. You're sounding like one of those nutty right-wingers. Bush and Cheney have departed the scene - remember?
        
        But sir. Iran is testing improved two-stage rockets. It is negotiating to buy 1,350 tons of purified uranium yellow-cake from private Kazakh suppliers. It disses everyone from the U.N. to you. It detests Israel and the U.S. It is shooting its own freedom-fighters in the streets. You talk of negotiations and diplomacy. Yet Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said earlier this month, "I don't think that anyone can doubt that our outreach has produced very little in terms of any kind of a positive response from the Iranians."
        
        WE'RE WORKING on engaging Iran, but it requires patience. Stay tuned. You've got concerns about terror and national security?
        
        Profound concerns, sir. Let's start with the attempted Christmas Day destruction of Northwest Flight 253 from Amsterdam to Detroit - and its 278 passengers. You basked on the beach here, and would have ripped President Bush for doing so in a similar circumstance (think 9/11 and Katrina). You assured Americans that they are still secure flying. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said "the traveling public is safe" and "the system worked."
        
        Well, it did. No one died.
        
        A consequence of luck and bravery aboard the flight, sir - similar to the bravery on Flight 93 over Pennsylvania on 9/11, without the luck (for those aboard, at least). Several days later you issued a statement citing an "unacceptable [and] catastrophic breach" of security regarding the near-success of Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab.
        
        We have things under control. The security of the American people is of course my highest priority - higher than combatting global warming and socializing the nation's health care.
        
        Yet you remained in Hawaii, sifting sand \.\.\.
        
        This has been a year of astounding achievement, as I have noted in my year-end interviews. And let's not forget the Nobel. Despite my comparative youth and my amazing vigor, I have to confess I'm tired. What would you have had me do?
        
        FOR STARTERS, you could have told your pilots to turn Air Force One around and flown home. You could have fired Janet Napolitano. And you could have acknowledged from the outset that we have a huge national security problem far larger than anything you imagined.
        
        We do?
        
        Well, yes. Two uninvited twits shaking your hand at your first state dinner. No racial profiling because of political correctness and the settlement worked out this year with the flying imams. Major Nidal Malik Hasan killing for Allah two months ago at Fort Hood. Five virgin-seekers from the D.C. area plotting to target American bases in Afpak (Afghanistan and Pakistan). And now Abdulmutallab, who should have had his visa revoked: His very father warned CIA operatives in Nigeria about his radicalization six weeks ago.
        
        Calm down. Those are isolated incidents.
        
        Abdulmutallab says he was working for al-Qaida. Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula has taken responsibility for setting up Abdulmutallab. Both he and Hasan may be acolytes of Yemen-based jihadist Anwar al-Awlaki. At least two former residents of Guantanamo - Said Ali al-Shirhi and Muhammad al-Awfi - are said to be in Yemen helping direct al-Qaida operations there. Maybe you should give up your notions of closing Guantanamo and liberating many of its inmates (more than 90 of them Yemenis) to foreign countries to resume warring against America.
        
        HAVE YOU forgotten about Iran?
        
        Sir, you need to get with the entire jihad program. These people clearly mean business, and that includes Iran - perhaps now the nexus, ground zero, in the war on terror (a phrase you have decreed no longer acceptable by members of your administration).
        
        As I said in the memo, which you evidently have seen, ours is not a "war on terror" - and certainly not, in that noxious Bush-Cheney phrase, "the long war."
        
        It is merely an "overseas contingency operation."
        
        And when will it be over? When will we know we have won it?
        
        We probably won't ever win it. That is why I dislike, and rarely use, the word "victory."
        
        This contingency operation will end when we give enough aid to peace-loving Muslims to lift them out of poverty.
        
        But Osama bin Laden is mega rich. Abdulmutallab hails from Nigeria's ruling class. Most of the 9/11 plotters were middle-class or better.
        
        And it will end when, given the heroism displayed (albeit by a Dutchman) aboard Northwest Flight 253, we understand the critical role citizens play when they take the reins in their own defense. That sort of defines what homeland security is all about.
        
        So does that mean, Mr. President, that you are going to leave the gun-control issue alone - and not try to deconstruct the Second Amendment, even have it declared unconstitutional?
        
        Aloha to you, my friend. Here's that mai-tai for the flight home.
        
        Aloha to you as well, sir. And thanks. And speaking of home, in the new year you might want to come home, too - figuratively as well as literally. Maybe you'll finally move national security and Iran to the front of the stove.

    textlede: US to expand military support for Arab state
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        LONDON: The United States will more than double its security assistance for Yemen and Britain will host an international meeting this month to seek ways of preventing the poorest Arab state from becoming an al-Qaeda stronghold.
        
        The moves highlighted mounting Western concern over Yemen after a failed Christmas Day attempt to bomb a US airliner by a Nigerian man who said he had received training and equipment in the country that borders Saudi Arabia.
        
        Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Yemen branch of Osama bin Laden's network, has claimed responsibility for the attempt by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab to ignite explosives hidden in his underwear as his flight from Amsterdam approached Detroit.
        
        British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said on Friday that Yemen presented a regional and global threat as an incubator and potential safe haven for terrorism.
        
        Brown's office said he would host a high-level meeting in London on January 28 to discuss countering radicalisation in Yemen.
        
        The talks will be held in parallel with an international conference on Afghanistan the same day.
        
        "The international community must not deny Yemen the support it needs to tackle extremism," Brown said.
        
        The increase in US backing for Yemen was announced in Baghdad by General David Petraeus, head of the US Central Command.
        
        "We have, it's well known, about $70 million (R735m) in security assistance last year. That will more than double this coming year," Petraeus said.
        
        US officials have said they are looking at ways to expand military and intelligence co-operation with Yemen to step up a crackdown on al-Qaeda militants there.
        
        But a Pentagon spokesman this week described as "grossly exaggerated" a report that Washington was preparing retaliatory strikes after the Detroit plane incident.
        
        Somalia's hardline Islamist rebel group al Shabaab said on Friday it was ready to send reinforcements to al-Qaeda in Yemen should the United States carry out strikes.
        
        "We call upon all Muslims to give a hand to our brothers in Yemen and we, al Shabaab, are ready to send them reinforcements... and Inshallah (God willing) we shall win over America," said Sheikh Mukhtar Robow Abuu Mansuur, a senior official of al Shabaab, which Washington sees as an al-Qaeda ally.
        
        Somalia is separated from Yemen by the Gulf of Aden, where Somali pirates have hijacked a number of international ships. Compounding the challenge from al-Qaeda, Yemen faces a separatist rebellion in the south and an insurgency by rebels from the minority Shi'ite Zaidi sect in the north.
        
        A Yemeni government source said on Friday 11 Shi'ite rebels, whom he described as "terrorists", had been killed in clashes with the military and security forces.
        
        The conflict, which has killed hundreds and displaced tens of thousands, drew in Saudi Arabia in November when rebels staged a cross-border incursion into the world's biggest oil exporter.
        
        The multiple security threats facing Yemen's government have intensified Saudi and Western concern that it could turn into an al-Qaeda haven and launch pad for international attacks - a role played by Afghanistan in the run-up to the September 11 attacks on the United States in 2001.
        
        Yemen's Foreign Minister Abubakr al-Qirbi said there could be up to 300 al-Qaeda militants in his country, some of whom may be planning attacks on Western targets. - Reuters

    textlede: From a decade's missteps, a new threat emerges; Errors by U.S., Yemen help al-Qaeda regroup in poor Mideast nation
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Nearly a decade after the bombing of the USS Cole, a combination of U.S. and Yemeni missteps, deep mistrust and a lack of political will have allowed al-Qaeda militants here to regroup and pose a major threat to the United States, according to Yemeni and U.S. officials, diplomats and analysts.
        
        The U.S. failures have included a lack of focus on al-Qaeda's growing stature, insufficient funding to and cooperation with Yemen, and a misunderstanding of the Middle Eastern country's complex political terrain, Yemeni officials and analysts said. U.S. policies in the region, they said, often alienated top Yemeni officials and did little to address the root causes of militancy.
        
        Frustrated American officials say Yemen never made fighting al-Qaeda a top priority, which has stalled large-scale U.S. support.
        
        These problems, which ultimately helped enable al-Qaeda militants here to plot an attack on a U.S. airliner on Christmas Day, have forced the United States to open a new front in its anti-terrorism efforts. It is part of a largely invisible war, stretching from the Arabian Peninsula to Africa, waged from the skies and from high-tech intelligence centers, with unmanned aircraft, CIA operatives and vivid satellite images serving as the weapons of choice.
        
        It is a war that challenges the Obama administration in ways that echo the conflicts in Pakistan and Afghanistan. These issues were on display in a U.S.-backed airstrike in southern Yemen on Dec. 17. The government said it struck an al-Qaeda training camp, killing at least 23 militants. But tribal leaders and residents say mostly civilians were killed. The strike has generated an outpouring of anger and anti-American sentiment across the south and in parliament.
        
        "I saw parts of bodies, mostly women and children," said Mukhbil Mohammed Ali, a tribal leader.
        
        "America says it supports Yemen to eradicate terrorists. But America is only supporting Yemen to kill the innocent."
        
        After years of paltry assistance, the United States last year provided $67 million in counterterrorism aid for training, intelligence and equipment. Assistance will more than double this year, Gen. David H. Petraeus, head of U.S. Central Command, said Friday in Baghdad before visiting Yemen the next day.
        
        U.S. commandos are training Yemen's security forces and coast guard in counterterrorism tactics. American drones and satellites are guiding airstrikes.
        
        But many say the war could arrive too late to change the trajectory in Yemen. Since the Cole attack, the nation has been on a path toward dissolution. The government is weak, unable to control large swaths of the country and the porous borders. It is stretched thin fighting a civil conflict in the north and a separatist movement in the south. It is burdened with crushing poverty and high unemployment; oil revenues and water supplies are shrinking.
        
        In this atmosphere, al-Qaeda has flourished. It is seeking to create an operational and training base to use Yemen, strategically tucked between oil-rich regions, key shipping routes and vast lawless areas, as a launching pad for global jihad. Increasingly, though, al-Qaeda is also targeting the government and its security apparatus.
        
        "The attack on the USS Cole should have been the loudest wake-up call against al-Qaeda," said Abdul Karim al-Iriyani, a former prime minister of Yemen.
        
        "But I don't think, even when I was in government, every attention was given to fighting al-Qaeda. Now, it is much more difficult than 2000."
        
        An erosion of trust
        
        On Oct. 12 of that year, al-Qaeda militants rammed an explosives-packed speedboat into the USS Cole, docked in the southern city of Aden, killing 17 U.S. sailors. In the aftermath, Yemeni and U.S. investigators worked together to tackle al-Qaeda, and their cooperation increased after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
        
        In November 2002, a U.S. Predator drone fired a missile at a car in eastern Yemen, killing six al-Qaeda suspects. They included the branch's leader, Abu Ali al-Harithi, whom the United States had linked to the Cole bombing.
        
        Stunned by the strike, senior Yemeni officials demanded that the Bush administration not reveal its involvement. Yemen is a conservative tribal society with deep sympathies for al-Qaeda's core message of protecting Islam. The government worried about a domestic backlash if it became known that it had allowed the United States to operate on its soil.
        
        But U.S. officials soon announced its success. That decision eroded Yemeni trust in the United States and damaged efforts to combat terrorism, Yemeni officials said.
        
        "I was so angry," Iriyani recalled.
        
        U.S. intelligence officials acknowledge that the strike posed a political liability for Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh. But they also contend that Yemen's government wavered in its commitment to fighting al-Qaeda even before that attack.
        
        By 2003, the United States was focused on the Iraq war and appeared more intent on fighting corruption and promoting democracy in Yemen than on tackling al-Qaeda, experts said.
        
        U.S. development aid to combat Yemen's soaring poverty rates and high unemployment -- key factors in enticing new recruits to militancy -- was minuscule. It declined from $56.5 million in 2000 to $25.5 million in 2008, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. U.S. officials say the aid was cut largely because of corruption concerns.
        
        "When you look back and see how little attention Yemen was getting several years ago, it's shocking," said Christopher Boucek, a Yemen analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
        
        "None of these problems with Yemen's stability are new, and we've known what was coming down the road."
        
        In 2006, 23 al-Qaeda militants broke out of a maximum security jail in Sanaa, the capital. They included several operatives involved in the Cole attack, as well as Nasser al-Wuhayshi, who became the leader of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Yemeni and U.S. officials say the militants were helped by Yemeni security officials sympathetic to al-Qaeda.
        
        U.S. counterterrorism aid to Yemen was $4.6 million that year.
        
        Today, the jailbreak is viewed as the genesis of the current generation of al-Qaeda militants in Yemen. But it was two more years before the United States substantially increased counterterrorism aid -- after al-Qaeda militants, including some who broke out of the jail, attacked the U.S. Embassy in September 2008, killing 16 people, including one American.
        
        Cole's aftereffects
        
        The ghosts of the USS Cole have haunted the U.S.-Yemen relationship throughout the past decade. All of the suspected attackers have been freed or escaped from prison, deepening tensions. Yemen's government has also refused to extradite to the United States two al-Qaeda militants, including one convicted of masterminding the Cole attack. Yemeni officials say their constitution bars the extradition of Yemeni nationals.
        
        U.S. officials said their counterterrorism efforts have also been hampered by a Yemeni government that has frequently been unpredictable and fickle in its support. After early successes in arresting and killing al-Qaeda operatives after Sept. 11, 2001, Yemeni officials appeared to pull back out of fear of alienating powerful tribes and religious figures.
        
        More vulnerable
        
        In the past two weeks, the government has intensified its attack on militants, bolstered by increased U.S. assistance and a sense that al-Qaeda is becoming a direct threat.
        
        But the more the government cracks down on suspected militants, the more vulnerable Yemen seems to become. In southern Yemen, opposition politicians and newspapers have accused the government of killing civilians in order to appease the United States. Yemeni officials have acknowledged that women and children were killed, but say they were the relatives of the militants.
        
        The aggressive tactics could backfire. As in Pakistan, al-Qaeda militants thrive on the support and protection of tribes, which are highly sensitive about outside interference, even from the government. The militants live among the population, raising the odds of civilian casualties.
        
        Mukhbil Mohammed Ali, the tribal leader, said his tribesmen are angry. They have even more sympathy for al-Qaeda, he said, as well as a growing animosity toward the Yemeni government and its benefactor, America.
        
        "We all want revenge," he said.

    textlede: U.S., Britain close Yemen embassies over al-Qaida threat after announcing more counterterror aid
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        SAN'A, YEMEN - The U.S. and Britain closed their embassies in Yemen today in the face of al-Qaida threats, after both countries announced an increase in aid to the government to fight the terror group linked to the failed attempt to bomb a U.S. airliner on Christmas.
        
        The confrontation with al-Qaida's offshoot in Yemen has gained new urgency since the 23-year-old Nigerian accused in the attack, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, told American investigators he received training and instructions from the group's operatives in Yemen. President Barack Obama said Saturday that the al-Qaida offshoot was behind the attempt.
        
        White House counterterrorism chief John Brennan said the American Embassy, which was attacked twice in 2008, was shut Sunday because of "indications al-Qaida is planning to carry out an attack against a target inside of San'a, possibly our embassy."
        
        "We're not going to take any chances" with the lives of embassy personnel, Brennan said. A statement on the embassy's Web site announcing the closure did not say how long it would remain closed.
        
        In London, Britain's Foreign Office said its embassy was closed for security reasons. It said officials would decide later whether to reopen it on Monday.
        
        The closure comes as Washington is dramatically stepping up aid to Yemen to fight al-Qaida, which has built up strongholds in remote parts of the impoverished, mountainous nation where government control outside the capital is weak.
        
        Over the weekend, Gen. David Petraeus, the U.S. general who oversees the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, announced that Washington this year will more than double the $67 million in counterterrorism aid that it provided Yemen in 2009. On Saturday, Petraeus met with Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh to discuss co-ordination in the fight against al-Qaida.
        
        Britain announced Sunday that Washington and London will fund a counterterrorism police unit in Yemen. Britain will also host a high-level international conference Jan. 28 to come up with an international strategy to counter radicalization in Yemen.
        
        The U.S. also provided intelligence and other help to back two Yemeni air and ground assaults on al-Qaida hide-outs last month, reported to have killed more than 60 people. Yemeni authorities said more than 30 suspected militants were among the dead.
        
        The U.S. has increasingly provided intelligence, surveillance and training to Yemeni forces during the past year, and has provided some firepower, a senior U.S. defence official has said. Some of that assistance may be through the expanded use of unmanned drones, and the U.S. is providing funding to Yemen for helicopters and other equipment. Officials, however, say there are no U.S. ground forces or fighter aircraft in Yemen.
        
        On Thursday, the embassy sent a notice to Americans in Yemen urging them to be vigilant about security.
        
        Yemeni security officials said over the weekend that the country had deployed several hundred extra troops to Marib and Jouf, two mountainous eastern provinces that are al-Qaida's main strongholds in the country and where Abdulmutallab may have visited. U.S. and Yemeni investigators have been trying to track Abdulmutallab's steps in Yemen, which he visited from August until Dec. 7. He was there ostensibly to study Arabic in San'a, but he disappeared for much of that time.
        
        Yemeni media also reported that the coast guard was increasing patrols to stop any incoming militants after an al-Qaida-linked insurgent group in Somalia, al-Shabab, claimed last week that it would send its fighters to help the terror group's offshoot there.
        
        Al-Qaida fighters have dramatically increased their presence in Yemen over the past year, taking advantage of the San'a government's weak control over much of the country. Tribes hold sway over large areas, and many of them are discontented with the central government and have given refuge to al-Qaida fighters, both Yemenis and other Arabs coming from Saudi Arabia or war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan.
        
        Yemen, the ancestral homeland of Osama bin Laden, was the scene of the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole, and in the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States, the Yemeni government worked with Washington to crack down on al-Qaida figures on its soil.
        
        But the terror group has rallied, announcing in January 2009 the creation of Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, grouping fighters from Yemen and neighbouring Saudi Arabia. The leader of the group, Naser Abdel Karim al-Wahishi, is a Yemeni who was once close to bin Laden, and two Saudis who were released from the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay in 2007 and 2006 have taken up senior roles - Said al-Shihri, the group's deputy leader, and Ibrahim Suleiman al-Rubaish, seen as its theological adviser.
        
        The Yemeni government, meanwhile, has been tied down battling two separate internal rebellions in the north and south. The various conflicts and the country's poverty and lack of resources have raised fears that instability could deepen.
        
        Located at the tip of the Arabian peninsula, Yemen straddles a strategic maritime crossroads at the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, the access point to the Suez Canal. Across the Gulf is Somalia, an even more tumultuous nation where the U.S. has said al-Qaida militants have been increasing their activity. Yemen also borders Saudi Arabia, the world's leading oil producer.
        
        There have been a spate of assaults on the U.S. Embassy in Yemen.
        
        In an attack in September 2008, gunmen and two vehicles packed with explosives attacked the U.S. Embassy, killing 19 people, including an 18-year-old American woman and six militants. None of those killed or wounded were U.S. diplomats or embassy employees. Al-Qaida in Yemen claimed responsibility.
        
        In March 2008, three mortars missed the U.S. Embassy and crashed into a high school for girls nearby, killing a security guard. In March 2003, two people were shot dead and dozens more were wounded as police clashed with demonstrators trying to storm the embassy.
        
        Last January, gunmen in a car exchanged fire with police at a checkpoint near the embassy, hours after the embassy received threats of a possible attack by al-Qaida. Nobody was injured. In April, embassy personnel were put on a one-week lockdown, barred from leaving their homes or the embassy after al-Qaida suicide bombings that targeted South Korean visitors.
        
        As recently as July, security was upgraded in San'a after intelligence reports warned of attacks planned against the U.S. Embassy.

    textlede: Yemen may well be the setting for this year's war on terror
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Yemen is the Afghanistan of the Arab world. It is the poorest Arab country, its government is weak, its people are armed, it already faces a serious rebellion, it is strongly tribal and its mountain ranges are a natural refuge for groups like al-Qaida.
        
        There is nothing new about the growing political, social and economic crisis in Yemen, but the world is waking up to it only since the attempt to blow up a Detroit-bound plane has been linked to al-Qaeda in Yemen.
        
        The regional wing of the group has claimed responsibility for training and arming Nigerian student Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab (pictured below) with the Christmas Day bomb.
        
        Yemen has been becoming increasingly unstable in the past two decades, ever since Saudi Arabia expelled a million Yemeni workers because Yemen refused to support the US-led war to expel Saddam Hussein's army from Kuwait in 1990.
        
        Osama bin Laden's family comes in part from Yemen. Yemenis played a role in the formation of al-Qaeda.
        
        A significant number of the suicide bombers in Iraq come from there. It has been a convenient bolt-hole for Saudi militants under pressure at home to escape to.
        
        The would-be Christmas Day bomber's personal connection to Yemen will be probed in coming days and weeks. But it is clear that al Qaida in Yemen has become stronger and is operating in a sympathetic environment -- in a country in which the mass of the population strongly opposes the US invasion of Iraq and intervention in Afghanistan.
        
        There have long been signs of al Qaida activity. The most spectacular was in 2000, when a boat packed with explosives rammed the USS Cole in Aden port, blowing a hole in its side and killing 17 US sailors.
        
        For a time the government in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, appeared to have arranged an unspoken ceasefire with the local branch of al Qaida.
        
        But the invasion of Iraq by the US led to a more militant leadership taking over the group.
        
        They were reinforced in 2006, when 23 prisoners escaped from prison in Sanaa, reportedly with the aid of sympathetic Yemeni security officers.
        
        The escapees included Nasir al-Wuhayshi, a leader of al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). Ever since, attacks have been increasing on foreign tourists and oil installations.
        
        In September 2008 a car bomb outside the heavily fortified US embassy in Sanaa killed 16 people, including six well-armed attackers.
        
        In spring 2008,Saudi commanders of al Qaida told their militants to move to Yemen, and in January 2009 the Saudi and Yemeni wings merged.
        
        Saudi Arabia announced a list of its 85 most wanted militant suspects, of whom it said 26 were in Yemen. This is probably the overall membership of AQAP, whose small size makes it difficult to find and eliminate.
        
        Last August a suicide bomber almost killed the Saudi anti-terrorism chief, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef. Last month AQAP killed three senior Yemeni security officers, with their bodyguards, in south Yemen.
        
        The Yemeni security chief, Ali Mohammad al-Ansi, says 29 al-Qaeda members who had been planning to attack the British embassy and oil installations have been arrested.
        
        Washington has quietly been supplying military equipment, intelligence and training to Yemeni forces, who have raided suspected al Qaida hideouts.
        
        On Christmas Eve, Yemeni forces targeted a gathering of top militant leaders, possibly killing a radical cleric linked to the US Army major accused of the Fort Hood shooting in the US in November.
        
        Joseph Lieberman, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, admitted recently that the growing US presence in Yemen includes Special Operations, Green Berets and intelligence.
        
        In 2009, the Pentagon provided Yemen with $67m (£42m) in overt counter-terrorism assistance; officials have proposed expanding that this year.
        
        Mr Lieberman, who recently visited Sanaa, said a US official there told him that "Iraq was yesterday's war. Afghanistan is today's war. If we don't act pre-emptively, Yemen will be tomorrow's war."
        
        The Yemeni government will do what it can to show willing to the US in pursuit of al Qaida.
        
        But the threat to its own existence comes from many directions: first, the civil war with Shia revivalists -- who it claims are backed by Iran -- in the northern province of Saada; then secessionism in the south sparked by discontent over the outcome of Yemeni unification in 1990 and the civil war that followed; and finally a growing economic crisis as Yemen's small oilfields, which provide revenue, are running out.
        
        Pressure from the US to pursue al Qaida will be one extra strain on a government which has been unable to cope with these multiple crises.

    textlede: Obama cites apparent al-Qaida link in bomb plot
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        HONOLULU (AP) -- An al-Qaida affiliate in Yemen apparently ordered the Christmas Day plot against a U.S. airliner, training and arming the 23-year-old Nigerian man accused in the failed bombing, President Barack Obama said Saturday.
        
        "This is not the first time this group has targeted us," Obama said, reporting on some of the findings of an administration review into how intelligence agencies failed to prevent Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab from boarding Detroit-bound Northwest Flight 253.
        
        In his most direct public language to date, Obama described the path through Yemen of Abdulmutallab. He also emphasized that the United States would continue its partnerships with friendly countries -- citing Yemen, in particular -- to fight terrorists and extremist groups.
        
        Obama's homeland security team has been piecing together just how Abdulmutallab was able to get on the plane. Officials have described flaws in the system and by those executing the strategy and have delivered a preliminary assessment.
        
        A senior administration official had said the United States was increasingly confident there was a link between Abdulmutallab and an al-Qaida affiliate, but Obama's statement was the strongest connection between the two.
        
        "We know that he traveled to Yemen, a country grappling with crushing poverty and deadly insurgencies. It appears that he joined an affiliate of al-Qaida, and that this group -- al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula -- trained him, equipped him with those explosives and directed him to attack that plane headed for America," the president said in his weekly radio and Internet address. It was released by the White House during Obama's vacation in Hawaii.
        
        Officials have said Abdulmutallab's father warned the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria that his son had drifted into extremism in the al-Qaida hotbed of Yemen. Abdulmutallab's threat was only partially digested by the U.S. security apparatus and not linked with a visa history showing the young man could fly to the United States.
        
        Obama has ordered a thorough look at the shortcomings that permitted the plot, which failed not because of U.S. actions but because the would-be attacker was unable to ignite an explosive device. He has summoned homeland security officials to meet with him in the White House Situation Room on Tuesday.
        
        Intelligence officials prepared for what was shaping up to be uncomfortable hearings before Congress about miscommunication among anti-terror agencies and sweeping changes expected under Obama's watch.
        
        Obama noted that in recent years, the al-Qaida affiliate in Yemen has bombed government facilities there as well as Western hotels, restaurants and embassies. An attack on the U.S. Embassy in 2008 killed one American.
        
        "So, as president, I've made it a priority to strengthen our partnership with the Yemeni government -- training and equipping their security forces, sharing intelligence and working with them to strike al-Qaida terrorists," he said.
        
        The United States provided Yemen $67 million in training and support under the Pentagon's counterterrorism program last year. Only Pakistan got more, with some $112 million.
        
        Obama said the money had been well spent: "Training camps have been struck, leaders eliminated, plots disrupted. And all those involved in the attempted act of terrorism on Christmas must know -- you too will be held to account."
        
        The U.S. general who oversees the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan told reporters in Baghdad on Friday that U.S. counterterrorism aid to Yemen would more than double in the coming year. Gen. David Petraeus said Yemen was struggling to overcome many challenges, including declining oil revenues and an insurgency making full use of the country's rugged terrain.
        
        "Al-Qaida are always on the lookout for places where they might be able to put down roots," he said.
        
        Security officials in Yemen said Saturday the government deployed several hundred extra troops to two mountainous eastern provinces that are al-Qaida's main strongholds in the country and where Abdulmutallab may have visited.

    textlede: HAVENS OF HATE; EXTREMISTS IN YEMEN, SOMALIA & NIGERIA ARE TURNING THEM INTO AL-QAEDA CRUCIBLES OF TERROR
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        THE Christmas plot to blow up a US jet confirms fears of sinister terror links between groups in Yemen, Somalia and Nigeria.
        
        Nigerian Umar Abdulmutallab, 23, who came close to detonating a bomb in his underpants on a flight heading for Detroit, is believed to have been radicalised in strife-torn Yemen.
        
        The desert state - dubbed "the new Afghanistan"- has emerged as the key development centre for the next generation of al-Qaeda bombs.
        
        There are even suggestions 25 Brits are being trained there in new methods of attacking planes.
        
        Across the Gulf of Yemen in Somalia, al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabab and other militant groups have taken control of most of the country beyond the capital Mogadishu.
        
        Now a huge swathe of Islamic militancy extends right across northern Africa to the Atlantic coast. There have been suggestions that al-Qaeda commanders have been shipping out of Pakistan and heading for Yemen and the new front line.
        
        And news of the foiling of another attempt to down an aircraft - this time in Somalia - provides further indication that the group is able to extend its reach far and wide.
        
        An unnamed Somali tried to board the plane in Mogadishu carrying chemicals, liquid and a syringe - just like Abdulmutallab.
        
        ACTIVITY
        
        He was arrested before the flight to Dubai on November 13 took off.
        
        As the US ramps up military activity in the region, there have also been reports that Britain's Secret Intelligence Service is rapidly increasing its presence, such is the perceived gravity of the threat.
        
        The pivotal moment behind the latest events can be traced back to last January and the merger of al-Qaeda's branches in Saudi Arabia and Yemen to form a new group called al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. In effect, al-Qaeda leaders decided to evacuate Saudi Arabia and base the organisation in Yemen, ancestral homeland of the bin Laden family.
        
        The Saudis have arrested thousands of suspected militants and say they have thwarted numerous plots.
        
        And while there is scepticism about some claims, there is little doubt al-Qaeda took the view that the country had become too hostile to operate in. The leaders opted for Yemen, primarily to take advantage of the political chaos caused by an insurgency being waged by Iranian-backed rebels in the north.
        
        The situation is developing into a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
        
        Earlier this week al-Qaeda in Yemen claimed responsibility for the attempted attack on Flight 253 over Detroit in a statement on al-Qaeda-linked websites. The document claimed the strike was revenge for US missile attacks on two training camps in Yemen on December 17, though it later emerged that Abdulmutallab bought his ticket eight days before these took place.
        
        Militant websites, however, have recently carried statements from the group's leaders threatening attacks against the US, Britain and economically vital oil installations.
        
        Another air strike was carried out in Yemen the day before the Detroit incident. It targeted a meeting of al-Qaeda leaders who gathered to discuss retaliation for the December 17 attack. Among those believed there was the leader of al-Qaeda in the region, Naser al-Wahishi, his deputy, and radical US preacher Anwar al-Awlaki.
        
        Some thirty people are believed to have been killed in the Christmas Eve missile attack though it is believed the primary targets survived.
        
        A forerunner to the airliner destruction attempts came in August when an al-Qaeda bomber tried to assassinate Saudi Arabia's head of security.
        
        Abdullah al-Asiri was flown in from Yemen on the understanding he would negotiate the surrender of the group's leaders.
        
        But during the meeting with Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, al-Asiri used a mobile phone to detonate a device in his rectum. The prince survived with minor injuries.
        
        The bomber was killed.
        
        His device contained PETN, the same explosive used by Abdulmutallab.
        
        The incident provided a strong indication the terror group has been using its bases in Yemen to design and test new types of bombs that can evade detection.
        
        Yemen would now seem to be the main regional HQ for an organisation exerting a growing influence across the top of Africa.
        
        The chaotic situation in Somalia - torn by civil war and with no effective government since 1991 - is long-running and well known.
        
        CRACKDOWN
        
        Nigeria, Abdulmutallab's home country, has taken an aggressive attitude to militant Islamic groups and strenuously denies al-Qaeda is operating from its territory.
        
        The government appears convinced it has headed off a terrorism problem in the north of the country with a crackdown last summer on a group called Boko Haram, which culminated in the reported death of its leader.
        
        Further to the west in Africa there have been a spate of kidnappings of foreign tourists: Al-Qaeda this week claimed responsibility for the abduction of two Italians in Mauritania. The group has also claimed the kidnapping of three Spanish nationals in Mali.
        
        The group involved is al-Qaeda's North Africa branch based on Euorpe's doorstep in Algeria.
        
        Its influence extends now to many neighbouring countries, including Morocco and Tunisia.
        
        It has long been waging an insurgency against the Algerian government and jihadist chatter in recent weeks suggests - ominously perhaps - that it is now commanded by a senior al-Qaeda leader in Pakistan.
        
        This frightening mesh of new terror links has developed over an astonishingly short time.
        
        There is little wonder Western military and intelligence agencies are scrambling to deal with it.

    textlede: HAVENS OF HATE; EXTREMISTS IN YEMEN, SOMALIA & NIGERIA ARE TURNING THEM INTO AL QAEDA CRUCIBLES OF TERROR
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        THE Christmas plot to blow up a US jet confirms fears of sinister terror links between groups in Yemen, Somalia and Nigeria.
        
        Nigerian Umar Abdulmutallab, who came close to detonating a bomb in his underpants on a flight heading for Detroit, is believed to have been radicalised in strife-torn Yemen.
        
        The desert state - dubbed "the new Afghanistan"- has emerged as the key development centre for the next generation of al-Qaeda bombs.
        
        There are even suggestions 25 Brits are being trained there in new methods of attacking airliners.
        
        Across the Gulf of Yemen in Somalia, al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabab and other militant groups have taken control of most of the country beyond the capital Mogadishu.
        
        Now a huge swathe of Islamic militancy extends right across northern Africa to the Atlantic coast.
        
        There have been suggestions that al-Qaeda commanders have been shipping out of Pakistan and heading for Yemen and the new front line.
        
        And news of the apparent foiling of another attempt to down an aircraft in Somalia provides a further indication that the group is able to extend its reach far and wide.
        
        The unnamed Somali tried last month to board the plane in Mogadishu carrying chemicals, liquid and a syringe, just like Abdulmutallab.
        
        ACTIVITY
        
        He was arrested before the flight to Dubai on November 13 took off.
        
        As the US ramps up military activity in the region, there have also been reports that Britain's Secret Intelligence Service is rapidly increasing its presence, such is the perceived gravity of the threat.
        
        The pivotal moment behind the latest events can be traced back to last January and the merger of al-Qaeda's branches in Saudi Arabia and Yemen to form a new group called al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. In effect, al-Qaeda leaders decided to evacuate Saudi Arabia and re-base the organisation in Yemen, ancestral homeland of the bin Laden family.
        
        The Saudis have arrested thousands of suspected militants and say they have thwarted numerous plots.
        
        And while there is scepticism about some claims, there is little doubt al-Qaeda took the view that the country had become too hostile to operate in. The leaders opted for Yemen, primarily to take advantage of the political chaos caused by an insurgency being waged by Iranian-backed rebels in the north.
        
        The situation is developing into a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
        
        Earlier this week al-Qaeda in Yemen claimed responsibility for the attempted jet attack over Detroit in a statement on al-Qaeda-linked websites.
        
        The document claimed the strike was revenge for US missile attacks on two training camps in Yemen on December 17, though it later emerged that Abdulmutallab bought his ticket eight days before these took place.
        
        Militant websites, however, have recently carried statements from the group's leaders threatening attacks against the US, Britain and economically vital oil installations.

Among those believed there was the leader of al-Qaeda in the region, Naser al-Wahishi, his deputy, and radical US preacher Anwar al-Awlaki.
        
        Some thirty people are believed to have been killed in the Christmas Eve missile attack though it is believed the primary targets survived.
        
        A forerunner to the airliner destruction attempts came in August when an al-Qaeda bomber tried to assassinate Saudi Arabia's head of security.
        
        Abdullah al-Asiri was flown in from Yemen on the understanding he would negotiate the surrender of the group's leaders.
        
        But during the meeting with Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, al-Asiri used a mobile phone to detonate a device in his rectum. The prince survived with minor injuries.
        
        The bomber was killed.
        
        His device contained PETN, the same explosive used by Abdulmutallab.
        
        The incident provided a strong indication the terror group has been using its bases in Yemen to design and test new types of bombs that can evade detection.
        
        Yemen would now seem to be the main regional HQ for an organisation exerting a growing influence across the top of Africa.
        
        The chaotic situation in Somalia - torn by civil war and without recognised government for years - is long-running and well known.
        
        CHAOTIC

    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        A cushy Saudi Arabian "rehab" center where terrorists are encouraged to express themselves through crayon drawings, water sports and video games is under scrutiny after one of its graduates re-emerged as a leader in the al Qaeda branch claiming responsibility for trying to blow up an airliner on Christmas.
        
        Said Ali al Shihri - a former Guantanamo Bay detainee who now heads the terror group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula - obviously didn't get to the bottom of his America-hating issues while undergoing the controversial rehab for jihadists.
        
        Inmates like Shihri are supposed to while away the days playing ping-pong, PlayStation and soccer in hopes that the peaceful environment will help them cope with their jihadist rages.
        
        Bomb-makers and gunmen participate in art therapy to help them explore their feelings non-violently.
        
        In between tasty picnic-style meals of rice and lamb and snacks of Snickers along with dips in the pool, participants practice Arabic calligraphy, produce dizzying Jackson Pollack rip-offs and imagine the aftermath of car bombings in crayon.
        
        Some 1,500 al Qaeda terrorists have "graduated" from the program, including 108 former Guantanamo Bay detainees, the Washington Post reported.
        
        "The Saudis talk about a success rate of 80 to 90 percent, but when you look at what those numbers mean in reality, it all falls down. There is no criteria for evaluation," John Horgan, a Department of Homeland Security consultant, told the New York Post.
        
        In 2009, Horgan visited several of the Saudi terrorism rehab centers to report on the programs for Homeland Security.
        
        "These guys are not being de-radicalized. They are being encouraged to disassociate from terrorism, but that doesn't mean their fundamental views changed," said Horgan, director of the International Center for the Study of Terrorism at Penn State.
        
        The Saudis launched the programs after the kingdom was rocked by a series of al Qaeda-inspired attacks in 2003 and 2004.
        
        But despite the Saudi government's best efforts, which also include setting up graduates with jobs, introductions to potential wives and new cars, many of the terrorists don't seem to be getting the peace message.
        
        "Several 'returnees' from Guantanamo Bay continue to espouse a virulent hatred of the United States and Western society in general," Horgan wrote in a September report.
        
        That includes Shihri, who has been busy ignoring the peaceful precepts he was taught in terror rehab and has resumed his hardcore jihadist ways.
        
        Shihri is a top member of the al Qaeda branch in Yemen which claims to have masterminded the failed plot to blow up Flight 253 to Detroit on Christmas Day. He also is suspected of coordinating the 2008 bombing of the US embassy in Yemen, ABC reported.
        
        Another former Gitmo detainee, Muhammad al Awfi, who went back to al Qaeda after his release, has ridiculed the Saudi efforts to rehabilitate jihadists as a plan to "drive us away from Islam."
        
        Shihri - who was released from Guantanamo Bay by President George W. Bush in 2007 - spent six to ten weeks at the Prince Mohammed bin Nayef Center for Care and Counseling, ABC News reported.
        
        "There are guards and gates and barbed wire but it's not quite prison," Christopher Boucek of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who has visited the center, told ABC.
        
        "It's a communal living environment that's more like 'Hogan's Heroes' than 'Escape From Alcatraz.' "
        
        A team of shrinks works with the inmates in managing their emotions, and they are given lessons in Islam from imams, who warn them that jihad is only acceptable when sanctioned by the state.
        
        Toward the end of their stint, some inmates are allowed to make unescorted visits to family members.
        
        "Some American officials say it's all about crayons and art therapy, but the things that don't translate are the intense emotional and intellectual strides that are made," Boucek told ABC.
        
        "They make intense bonds with the sheiks and doctors they work with. The majority is a religious discussion giving them religious evidence to the contrary of why they think their beliefs are based on Islam."
        
        Meanwhile, in the aftermath of the failed bombing of Flight 253, some US legislators have called for the White House to stop plans to release Guantanamo detainees.
        
        There is particular concern over Gitmo inmates with ties to Yemen, where would-be underwear bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab says he connected with al Qaeda.
        
        However, an Obama administration aide told the Washington Post that the administration wants to close the prison because it has become a "rallying cry" for terrorist recruiters.
        
        Another official told the newspaper that the government has no choice to release some Gitmo detainees because of challenges in federal court.

    textlede: Q. IS YEMEN: (A) THE NEXT FRONT IN THE WAR ON TERROR? (B) A STAUNCH U.S. ALLY? (C) A NEARLY FAILED STATE? (D) ALL OF THE ABOVE?; News that the Christmas Day airline plot originated in Yemen was no surprise to a Star correspondent who has watched that country's branch of Al Qaeda flourish in recent years. Was it an omen of more serious things to come?
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        "Iraq was yesterday's war. Afghanistan is today's war. If we don't act pre-emptively, Yemen will be tomorrow's war."
        
        That's what U.S. Senator Joseph Lieberman, head of the Homeland Security Committee, said he was told by a U.S. government official during a recent visit to Yemen's capital, Sana'a.
        
        Yemen had been creeping into counter-terrorism debates for months, often cited as "a key battleground" for extremism, or, as Gen. David Petraeus suggested in April, an Al Qaeda "safe haven."
        
        But the claim of responsibility from Yemen-based Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) for the failed Christmas Day plot to bomb a Detroit-bound flight has pushed Yemen to the forefront.
        
        It spells more bad news for the Arabian nation of 23 million, already suffering from dwindling water and oil supplies, an insurgency in the north and a southern secessionist movement. Add to this the fact that it is already the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula with an unemployment rate of 40 per cent - and Yemen's population is expected to double by 2035.
        
        But not since the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole that killed 19 American sailors has Yemen received such foreign scrutiny as it has these past weeks.
        
        And that, warns Barbara Bodine, the former U.S. Ambassador to Yemen, could be dangerous.
        
        "I think it would be a major mistake to turn this into a third front, if Iraq and Afghanistan are somehow front number one and number two," said Bodine in an interview with the Star.
        
        "If we try to deal with this as an American security problem and dealt with by American military, we risk exacerbating the problem."
        
        Bodine, who served as ambassador from 1997 until August 2001, and is now a lecturer at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, said while AQAP poses a serious threat, the U.S. must learn from mistakes in Iraq and Afghanistan.
        
        "If we go in and make this our war ... it is suddenly going to become a war against us and we will lose it," she said.
        
        Military might alone cannot contain the threat, suggests a recent report from the Center for a New American Security.
        
        "The best scenario is for Yemen to emerge as a stable, functioning state - unlikely to break up in ways that threaten regional security - that presents no sanctuary for transnational terrorist groups. Yet this is an ideal; American policy alone cannot bring about such an outcome," the November report states.
        
        "The objective of U.S. policy should therefore be more modest and aimed at helping to bring Yemen back from the brink by increasing its domestic stability. This task will not be achieved easily, quickly, or inexpensively."
        
        Prior to the attempted airline attack, Yemen's security forces had already stepped up strikes against suspected AQAP members, including the Christmas Eve bombing (reportedly based on U.S. intelligence) of alleged leaders meeting in a southeastern mountain valley.
        
        The U.S. presence in the country had also already increased since the September 2008 suicide bombing of the American embassy in Sana'a. Quoting an unnamed former senior CIA official, the New York Times reported this week that the agency sent several of its top field operatives with counter-terrorism experience to the country a year ago and Lieberman confirmed that Special Operations commandos have been training security forces.
        
        A Star reporter and photographer witnessed this training firsthand last summer after being invited to join Yemen's security forces. Driven to a barren valley just outside the city limits, members of Yemen's counter-terrorism unit, which includes an elite all-female division, staged a mock takedown of a high-value target and suicide bomber under the direction of American agents.
        
        But agitated by the presence of journalists, the exercise was called off prematurely by a U.S. operative, much to the consternation of the Yemeni forces who had invited the Star and said they had been preparing for the exercise for weeks.
        
        This close co-operation between President Ali Abdullah Saleh's government and the U.S. administration - both under the Bush and Obama administrations - and the presence of U.S. agents in the country is no secret inside Yemen.
        
        The relationship reaches back to November 2001, when President Saleh made it clear during a Washington visit that he supported the U.S. war in Afghanistan. A year later, an unmanned CIA drone killed Yemen's most senior Al Qaeda member.
        
        And by 2003, it appeared that Al Qaeda as it existed before the 9/11 attacks was no longer a serious threat in Yemen. Aspiring jihadists had flocked to the war in Iraq and Saleh's security forces fought a northern insurgency that was seen as a far greater threat to Yemen's stability than Al Qaeda.
        
        At the same time, the Bush administration cut $20 million in aid to Yemen in protest over the government's failure to extradite two terrorism suspects.
        
        Princeton's Gregory Johnsen, regarded as one of the foremost U.S. experts on Yemen, said announcing the funding cut during a Washington visit by Saleh was regarded as a diplomatic slap in the face.
        
        "He really felt that he was going to be rewarded for being this stalwart ally on the war on terror and he gets to Washington and the U.S. cuts his aid and then the next day the World Bank slices his aid from $420 million a year to $280 million," Johnsen said.
        
        "The reason the U.S. gave (for the funding cut) was corruption. That's true. Yemen's government is very corrupt, there is rampant corruption, and this is a serious problem that has to be dealt with. But when President Saleh went to Washington, a trip that's very politically important to him, and got slapped around so publicly, this has repercussions."
        
        Bodine agrees that the U.S. policy was shortsighted.
        
        "We slashed programs that helped deal with governance and rule of law and the kind of building blocks of a more legitimate state that's in our long-term interest as well as Yemen's," she said.
        
        Meanwhile, a heavy-handed crackdown in Saudi Arabia in 2004 and 2005 pushed many of its Al Qaeda's members south over the border, to Yemen.
        
        With these factors providing the backdrop, in February 2006, 23 prisoners with suspected links to Al Qaeda tunnelled out of the main prison in Sana'a - with suspected help from both inside and outside of the prison. Two of those escaped prisoners - Nassar Al Wahishi and Qasim Al Raimi - now head AQAP.
        
        But what really bolstered the organization's ranks was the January 2009 merger with the members of a struggling Saudi group.
        
        Two former Guantanamo Bay detainees, and graduates of the Saudi rehabilitation program, appeared in a video announcing the merger and assumed senior positions (although one later left and surrendered to Saudi authorities). The group went public just days after U.S. President Barack Obama's inauguration and vow to shut Guantanamo.
        
        "This is an organization that started out really small in 2006, but it's very ambitious and has learned from the mistakes its predecessors had made," Johnsen says of AQAP today.
        
        Yet until the claim of responsibility for the U.S. airline plot, the goals of the group had been local.
        
        "It has certainly poured most of its resources into conducting attacks first in Yemen and then into Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Arabian Peninsula," Johnsen said.
        
        "So whether this person was a trial balloon or it's something else, it's at this point, so soon after the incident, it's too difficult to tell."

    textlede: U.S. boosts security aid; Increased effort aims at preventing new al-Qaida stronghold
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        The United States will more than double its security assistance for Yemen and Britain will host an international meeting this month to seek ways of preventing the poorest Arab state from becoming an al-Qaida stronghold.
        
        The moves highlighted mounting western concern over Yemen after a failed Christmas Day attempt to bomb a U.S. airliner by a Nigerian man who said he had received training and equipment in the country, which borders Saudi Arabia.
        
        Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, the Yemen branch of Osama bin Laden's network, has claimed responsibility for the attempt by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab to ignite explosives hidden in his underwear as his flight from Amsterdam approached Detroit.
        
        British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said on Friday that Yemen presented a regional and global threat as an incubator and potential safe haven for terrorism.
        
        Brown's office said he would host a high-level meeting in London on Jan. 28 to discuss countering radicalization in Yemen. The talks will be held in parallel with an international conference on Afghanistan the same day.
        
        "The international community must not deny Yemen the support it needs to tackle extremism," Brown said in a statement.
        
        The increase in U.S. backing for Yemen was announced in Baghdad by General David Petraeus, head of the U.S. Central Command.
        
        "We have, it's well known, about $70 million in security assistance last year. That will more than double this coming year," Petraeus told a news conference.
        
        U.S. officials have said they are looking at ways to expand military and intelligence cooperation with Yemen in order to step up a crackdown on al-Qaida militants there.
        
        But a Pentagon spokesman this week described as "grossly exaggerated" a report that Washington was preparing retaliatory strikes after the Detroit plane incident.
        
        Somalia's hardline Islamist rebel group al Shabaab said on Friday it was ready to send reinforcements
        
        to al-Qaida in Yemen should the United States carry out strikes.
        
        "We call upon all Muslims to give a hand to our brothers in Yemen and we, al Shabaab, are ready to send them reinforcements... and Inshallah[God willing] we shall win over America," said Sheikh Mukhtar Robow Abuu Mansuur, a senior official of al Shabaab, which Washington sees as an al-Qaida ally.
        
        Somalia is separated from Yemen by the Gulf of Aden, where Somali pirates have hijacked a number of international ships.
        
        Compounding the challenge from al-Qaida, Yemen faces a separatist rebellion in the south and an insurgency by rebels from the minority Shi'ite Zaidi sect in the north.
        
        A Yemeni government source told Reuters on Friday that 11 Shi'ite rebels, whom he described as "terrorists," had been killed in clashes with the military and security forces.
        
        The conflict, which has killed hundreds and displaced tens of thousands, drew in neighbouring Saudi Arabia in November when rebels staged a cross-border incursion into the world's biggest oil exporter.
        
        The multiple security threats facing Yemen's government have intensified Saudi and western concern that it could turn into an al-Qaida haven and launch pad for international attacks-- a role played by Afghanistan in the run-up to the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States in 2001.
        
        Yemen's Foreign Minister Abubakr al-Qirbi said this week there could be up to 300 al-Qaida militants in his country, some of whom may be planning attacks on western targets.
