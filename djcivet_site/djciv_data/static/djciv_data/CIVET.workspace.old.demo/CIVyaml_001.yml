    textlede: UN blacklists Yemeni al-Qaeda group
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        The United Nations security council has added the Yemen-based Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to its list of outlawed organisations. Two of the group's purported leaders, Nasser al-Wahayshi and Qasim al-Raymi, also face new restrictions after the move by the international body's sanctions committee on Tuesday.
        
        Among the sanctions against the two men, who were among 23 fighters who escaped from a jail in Sanaa in 2006, were worldwide freezes on their assets and travel bans. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claims to have been behind the failed attempt to blow up a Detriot-bound airliner on Christmas Day as well as other attacks inside Yemen and Saudi Arabia.
        
        "Today's actions strengthen international efforts to degrade the capabilities of AQAP," Susan Rice, the US ambassador to the United Nations, said. 'Dismantle and defeat' The UN committee made its decision the day after the US state department added the al-Qaeda group to it list of proscribed organisations.
        
        "We are determined to eliminate AQAP's ability to execute violent attacks and to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat their networks," Philip Crowley, a state department spokesman, said. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was formed in January 2009 after the merger of groups in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. It has since set up bases inside Yemen and has been blamed for the suicide attack on South Korean tourists in March 2009 and an attempt to assassinate the Saudi deputy interior minister across the border in neighbouring Saudi Arabia. Yemen has bolsetered its troops in three of the country's provinces in an attempt to tackle al-Qaeda and has carried out a number of air raids, which it claims have left dozens of fighters dead. Al-Raymi was among a number of senior al-Qaeda figures reported to have been killed in a Yemeni attack on two vehicles on Friday. The government in Sanaa is also battling so-called Houthi rebels in the north and a secessionist movement in the south.

    textlede: Interview: Richard Barrett
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        The failed Christmas Day airliner attack has resuscitated fears of terrorism in the US. But that fear is no longer focused on Afghanistan, where 68,000 US troops are stationed, or on Iraq, with 120,000 US troops. For now the focus has switched to Yemen. Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian man accused of trying to blow up the US airliner bound for Detroit, had spent the few months before the attack in Yemen and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has claimed responsibility for the attempted attack.
        
        Four months ago, a suicide bomber from the same group, using a similar explosive, nearly killed a top Saudi counterterrorism minister. Former British intelligence official, Richard Barrett, the UN's highest ranking official responsible for monitoring the activities of al-Qaeda and the Taliban, tells Al Jazeera, that AQAP is the most dangerous of al-Qaeda's regional offshoots and that its mission is to destabilise the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. He recently spoke with Al Jazeera. Al Jazeera: How strong is AQAP compared with al-Qaeda's presence in Afghanistan and Pakistan? Richard Barrett: AQAP has until recently focused on targets in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and may continue to do so. But the attempt to bring down an aircraft over Detroit on December 25 shows that, where the means exist, AQAP may also launch attacks outside the region. It remains to be seen whether they have the capacity to do so on a continuing basis. AQAP, however, is like the other al-Qaeda affiliates in that its main objectives are local. Al-Qaeda in Iraq is now a marginal group which is as unlikely as it ever was to have any meaningful influence over the political process there. It still appears to be sectarian and backward looking, apparently now working with ex-Baathists.
        
        Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has been increasingly pushed to the ungoverned areas of Southern Algeria and Northern Mali and has not managed to get active operational supporters in Europe. Its agenda remains local. Al-Shabab in Somalia claim allegiance to al-Qaeda, but the al-Qaeda leadership has not recognised this and the fight in Somalia seems to have remained, so far, local and tribal. The al-Qaeda leadership in the Afghan/Pakistan border area is constrained by military action and is not in a position to plan and mount major attacks. So my conclusion is that compared to the even weaker state of other parts of al-Qaeda, AQAP is currently probably its strongest part. You recently said al-Qaeda operatives hiding in Yemen are the most dangerous ...
        
        I do believe they are very dangerous - they are young, they are hotheaded and of course as the Saudi Arabian authorities have being successful in pushing al-Qaeda supporters out of Saudi Arabia, they have tended to go to Yemen and join with Yemenis there who are keen to support their attacks in Saudi Arabia over the border. And that area there is difficult for the Yemenis to control and the Yemenis of course have a great deal on their hands with the rebellion in the North and the separatist movement in the South, with all the economic and social problems they face in addition. Has the government of Yemen done enough to combat AQAP? Should the international community have done more to stop the growing threat AQAP poses in Yemen? The Yemeni authorities have a lot of problems on their plate and it is very difficult to deal with because, of course, they need to have the cooperation of the tribes to deal with it. But I think the involvement of the international community inside Yemen is a delicate issue that the Yemenis should be fully in control of - so maybe we should have responded more to Yemeni requests for assistance and I see that the US and the European Union have increased their support for Yemen over recent months which suggests perhaps they could have done this earlier. I am not sure Yemen sees it as such a threat - certainly not as much as the rest of the world does following the December 25 attempt. But I think the international community was very well aware of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the threat it could be posing. And of course Saudi Arabia in particular was because it was made up of Saudis and their objectives were to attack targets in Saudi Arabia. Why is Saudi Arabia their main target? Saudi Arabia is the heartland for al-Qaeda. It has always been a target for them. I think it is both the Western dependence on Saudi Arabian oil but also the alliance between Saudi Arabia and the West, which is very strong, and I think what the al-Qaeda people see is that if they could attack the economic infrastructure in Saudi Arabia they would be achieving two aims: that is weakening the West but also weakening the authorities in Saudi Arabia which, of course, they don't support at all. Do you think al-Qaeda remains a global threat? Al-Qaeda is still very determined that's the thing. I think they are very weakened and they have been unable to mount big operations as they would like to but it's still a threat.

    textlede: Yemen jets raid 'al-Qaeda hideout'
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Yemeni fighter jets have attacked the home of a suspected leader of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, as the military steps up pressure on the group. A Yemeni tribal source said a number of people had been killed in Wednesday's air raids in Erq al-Shabwan village in Maarib province.
        
        The source said the wave of raids, which began in the morning, targeted the house of Ayed al-Shabwani, one of six al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula leaders the government said were killed in an air attack last week. A military official, who would not be named, said there had been three attacks on the house and one on an orange grove near the village where the authorities think al-Shabwani had built a safe haven for dozens of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula members. Al Jazeera's Mohamed Vall reporting from Aden, said: "[The air raids] started around noon 130km east of Sanaa and the government said they have targeted the home and the farm of el-Shabani, who is one of the names that the government said has been killed last week. Al-Qaeda denied that but the government did not comment on al-Qaeda's denial.
        
        "There were four raids in that area and the government says there was an exchange of fire and that al-Qaeda members were armed with anti-aircraft weapons which they tried to use against the government aircraft but they did not talk about any al-Qaeda casualties and this time around the government has refrained from giving that kind of information."
        
        Large deployment The official said that there had been a large deployment of government troops at the city of Maarib, about 5km from Erq al-Shabwan. During the afternoon, witnesses said, jets twice fired missiles at the orange grove and afterwards continued to fly in the area. The raids come just days after Yemen said it had killed six suspected leaders, including Shabwani, of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in Saada province, north of the capital Saana. Al Jazeera's correspondent in Yemen also reported that "The Yemeni army website published news that one al-Qaeda member was killed in clashes with security forces in Lahij which is about 50km north of Aden, and they said that this took place after a government vehicle had been hijacked by al-Qaeda members and there was an exchange of fire between the two sides in which the member was killed."
        
        Yemen is under US pressure to clamp down on Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which claimed responsibility for the December 25 bid to blow up a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam as it landed in Detroit.

    textlede: UK suspends direct Yemen flights
    textcmt: 
    textoriginal: |
        Britain is suspending direct flights to Yemen as part of security measures implemented in the wake of an attempted airliner bombing on Christmas Day.
        
        Gordon Brown, the UK prime minister, told parliament on Wednesday that the country would introduce new no-fly lists in response to what he said was a threat from al-Qaeda-affiliated fighters in Yemen.
        
        "We know that a number of terrorist cells are trying to target Britain and other countries," he said. He called Yemen "an incubator and safe haven" for such fighters.
        
        "We have agreed with Yemenia airlines - pending enhanced security - that they suspend their direct flights to the UK from Yemen with immediate effect," Brown said. Body scanners A Yemenia official told the Reuters news agency that Britain had requested the airline first stop in a third country for security checks if it wants to fly to the UK. The official said no other countries had suspended direct flights. The decision to increase airport security comes after a Nigerian alleged to have links with extremist elements in Yemen was accused of attempting to blow up a Northwest Airlines flight to the US using concealed explosives. Britain has already announced that full-body scanners will be set up at London's Heathrow airport within weeks. It also comes as Yemen faces increased pressure from the West to clamp down on al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which claimed responsibility for the December 25 incident. Yemen's government says it is winning the battle against al-Qaeda-affiliated fighters, pointing to two air attacks in December which it said killed more than 60 suspected members.
