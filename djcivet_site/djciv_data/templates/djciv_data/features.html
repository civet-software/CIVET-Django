<h2>System Features</h2>
<ul>
	<li>We are currently developing this based on a fixed frame that is  960 pixels wide and 700 pixels high: this will fit easily on a 1024x768 screen. This is probably quite conservative&mdash;see <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_display.asp">this link</a> for screen sizes being used by visitors to a popular development web site&mdash;but it is not unheard of for data labs to have older equipment so we're going with this at the moment</li>
	
	<li>The prototype is currently deployed in the cloud on the &ldquo;Google App Engine&rdquo;; we currently expect the operational version will be deployed on a UNC server. </li>
	
<li>The system is written using the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> framework, a Python-based system which is widely available on various cloud platforms. </li>

<li>The complete CIVET code will be licensed onto one of the open source licenses, probably the MIT license, and provided on GitHub.  </li>
