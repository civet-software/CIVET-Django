<p>This is the home page for a prototype of the CIVET&mdash;Contentious Incident Variable Entry Template&mdash;data entry system. CIVET is being developed by the NSF-sponsored project titled &ldquo;A Method for Leveraging Public Information Sources for Social Science Research&rdquo; which is creating tools to improve the efficiency of data generation in the social sciences, with an initial focus on coding event data in the domain of contentious political.

<p> The system you are looking at is a rather ugly <em>prototype</em> and provides a testbed of testing the functionality of some of various elements we expect to have in the final system. It will also be evolving as we add additional elements.

<!--<p>The prototype is currently deployed in the cloud on the &ldquo;Google App Engine&rdquo;; we currently expect the operational version will be deployed on a UNC server though the code will be available if you wish to create your own local or cloud versions. -->

<p>The prototype is currently deployed as a &ldquo;Django&rdquo; (<tt>https://www.djangoproject.com/start/overview/</tt>) application; it should be possible to get this working by installing Django on a local machine and copying the directory <tt>djcivet_site</tt>. We currently expect the operational version will be deployed on a UNC server though the code will be available if you wish to create your own local or cloud versions.
