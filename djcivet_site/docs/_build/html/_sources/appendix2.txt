Fields marked with \*\* are required.

========================
Text fields
========================

\*\*textid

    workspace, and given how collections might get mixed across
    workspace folders, ideally should be unique for the entire project.

    assigned by the program.

textmkupcoder
    coder ID

========================
Case fields

    Date and time this case was coded [provided by system]

casecmt
    comment for case

casecoder
    coder ID

casevalues
    This is a string formatted as a Python dictionary which contains
    pairs of variable names and values

========================
Date formats
========================

[This has not been consistently implemented in Beta-0.7]

Dates are ISO-8601 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_8601;
http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime; https://xkcd.com/1179/;
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/mgk25/iso-time.html) so generally either

-  YYYY-MM-DD

-  YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss

-  YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[+-]hh:mm

========================
Sample File
========================

The following figure shows an example of a simple YAML file; This is a screen capture of a file being edited with *BBEdit*,
hence the color mark-up. A workspace demonstration file with several collections can also be downloaded in the program.
