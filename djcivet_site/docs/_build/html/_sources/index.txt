    \section*{Preface}


This is the documentation for the CIVET—Contentious Incident Variable Entry Template—data entry system. 
CIVET was developed under the NSF-sponsored project titled “A Method for Leveraging Public Information 
Sources for Social Science Research” which is creating tools to improve the efficiency of data generation 
in the social sciences, with an initial focus on coding event data in the domain of contentious politics.

The system is deployed as a `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/start/overview/>`_ application; 
it should be possible to get this working by installing Django on a local machine and copying the directory ``djcivet_site``.  

We are very interested in feedback on this system, including any bugs
you encounter (please let us know what operating system (e.g. Windows,
OS-X) and browser (e.g. FireFox, Explorer, Chrome) you were using),
aspects of the manual that are unclear (and features that appear too
complex), and additional features that would be useful. Please send any
suggestions to `schrodt735@gmail.com <schrodt735@gmail.com>`__.

    \subsection*{Note on the PDF version of the documentation}
    
    .. only:: latex

    The PDF is generated by the Sphinx system from the same files used to produce the
    in-line documentation and some aspects of the formatting, most notably the insertion
    of a myriad of superfluous blank pages, presumably at the behest of the Koch brothers
    paper companies, and the identification of ``Parts``, rather suck compared to what
    the author would do (or rather, originally did) with a LaTeX-native version. That 
    said, the in-line version of the documentation is clearly far more important, and
    most efforts will be devoted to that.
    
    .. only:: latex

    Having said this, if anyone can advise me on getting the files to be recognized
    as chapter without using ``latex_use_parts = True`` in ``conf.py``, I would 
    appreciate learning about that.
